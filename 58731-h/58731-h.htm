<p class="noindent">DEAR SIR,</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Since my return from Darmstadt,
the weather has been so very bad,
that I have passed the time mostly
at home. That I may obey your injunctions
to write regularly at the stated periods,
I will send you the substance of a
conversation I had within these few days
with a foreigner, a man of letters, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
whom I am in a considerable degree of intimacy.</p>

<p>This gentleman has never been in England,
but he speaks the language a little,
understands it very well, and has studied
many of our best Authors. He said,
that he had found in some English books,
a solidity of reasoning, and a strength of
expression, superior to any thing he had
met with elsewhere;—that the English
history furnished examples of patriotism
and zeal for civil liberty, equal to what
was recorded in the Greek or Roman
story;—that English poetry displayed a
sublimity of thought, and a knowledge of
the human heart, which no writings, ancient
or modern, could surpass; and in
philosophy it was pretty generally allowed,
that the English nation had no rival.—He
then mentioned the improvements made by
Englishmen in medicine and other arts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
their superiority in navigation, commerce,
and manufactures; and even hinted something
in praise of a few English statesmen.
He concluded his panegyric by saying,
that these considerations had given him the
highest idea of the English nation, and had
led him to cultivate the acquaintance of
many Englishmen whom he had occasionally
met on their travels. But he frankly
acknowledged, that his connection with
these had not contributed to support the
idea he had formed of their nation.</p>

<p>As I had heard sentiments of the same
kind insinuated by others, I replied at some
length, observing, that if he had lived in
the most brilliant period of Roman grandeur,
and had accidentally met with a few
Romans in Greece or Asia, and had formed
his opinion of that illustrious commonwealth
from the conduct and conversation
of these travellers, his ideas would, in all
probability, have been very different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
those which the writings of Livy, Cæsar,
Cicero, and Virgil, had given him of the
Roman people:—That the manners and
behaviour of the few English he might
have met abroad, so far from giving him a
just view of the character of the whole
nation, very possibly had led him to false
conclusions with regard to the character of
those very individuals. For that I myself
had known many young Englishmen who,
after having led a dissipated, insignificant
kind of life while on their travels, and
while the natural objects of their ambition
were at a distance, had changed their conduct
entirely upon their return, applied to
business as eagerly as they had formerly
launched into extravagance, and had at
length become very useful members of the
community.</p>

<p>But, continued I, throwing this consideration
out of the question, the real
character of a people can only be discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
by living among them on a familiar
footing, and for a considerable time. This
is necessary before we can form a just idea
of any nation; but perhaps more so with
respect to the English, than any other: for
in no nation are the education, sentiments,
and pursuits of those who travel, so different
from those of the people who remain at
home.</p>

<p>The first class is composed of a few invalids,
a great many young men raw from
the university, and some idle men of fortune,
void of ambition, and incapable of
application, who, every now and then,
saunter through Europe, because they
know not how to employ their time at
home.</p>

<p>The second class is made up of younger
brothers, who are bred to the army, navy,
the law, and other professions;—all who
follow commerce, are employed in manufactures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
or farming;—and, in one word,
all who, not being born to independent
fortunes, endeavour to remedy that inconveniency
by industry, and the cultivation of
their talents.</p>

<p>England is the only country in Europe
whose inhabitants never leave it in search
of fortune. There are, moderately speaking,
twenty Frenchmen in London for
every Englishman at Paris. By far the
greater part of those Frenchmen travel to
get money, and almost all the English to
spend it. But we should certainly be led
into great errors, by forming an idea of
the character of the French nation from
that of the French fiddlers, dancing-masters,
dentists, and valet-de-chambres to be
met with in England, or other parts of
Europe.</p>

<p>The gentleman acknowledged, that it
would be unfair to decide on the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
character from that of their fiddlers and
dancing-masters; but added, that he did
not perceive that the English could reasonably
complain, should foreigners form
an opinion of their national character from
the men of fortune, rank, and the most
liberal education of their island.</p>

<p>I answered, they certainly would, because
young men of high rank and great fortune
carry a set of ideas along with them from
their infancy, which very often disappoint
the purposes of the best education.—— Let
a child of high rank be brought up with
all the care and attention the most judicious
parents and matters can give;—let him
be told, that personal qualities alone can
make him truly respectable;—that the
fortuitous circumstances of birth and fortune
afford no just foundation for esteem;—that
knowledge and virtue are the true
sources of honour and happiness;—that
idleness produces vice and misery;—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
without application he cannot acquire
knowledge;—and that without knowledge
he will dwindle into insignificance, in spite
of rank and fortune:—— Let these things
be inculcated with all the power of persuasion;
let them be illustrated by example,
and insinuated by fable and allegory;—yet,
do we not daily see the effect
of all this counteracted by the insinuations
of servants and base sycophants, who give
an importance to far different qualities,
and preach a much more agreeable doctrine?——</p>

<p>They make eternal allusions in all their
discourse and behaviour to the great estate
the young spark is one day to have, and the
great man he must be, independent of any
effort of his own. They plainly insinuate,
if they do not directly say it, that study and
application, tho’ proper enough for hospital
boys, is unnecessary, or perhaps unbecoming
a man of fashion. They talk with rapture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the hounds, hunters, and race-horses of
one great man; of the rich liveries and brilliant
equipage of another; and how much
both are loved and admired for their liberality
to their servants. They tell their young
master, that his rank and estate entitle him
to have finer hounds, horses, liveries and
equipage than either, and to be more liberal
to his servants; and consequently a greater
man in every respect. This kind of poison,
being often poured upon the young
sprouts of fortune and quality, gradually
blasts the vigour of the plants, and renders
all care and cultivation ineffectual.</p>

<p>If we suppose that domestics of another
character could be placed about a boy of
high rank, and every measure taken to inspire
him with other sentiments; he cannot
stir abroad, he cannot go into company
without perceiving his own importance,
and the attention that is paid to him. His
childish pranks are called spirited actions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
his pert speeches are converted into bon
mots; and when reproved or punished by
his parent or master, ten to one but some
obsequious intermeddler will tell him that
he has suffered great injustice.</p>

<p>The youth, improving all this to the purposes
of indolence and vanity, arrives at
length at the comfortable persuasion, that
study or application of any kind would in
him be superfluous;—that he ought only
to seek amusement, for at the blessed age of
twenty-one, distinction, deference, admiration,
and all other good things will be
added unto him.</p>

<p>A young man, on the other hand, who
is born to no such expectations, has no sycophants
around him to pervert his understanding;—when
he behaves improperly, he
instantly sees the marks of disapprobation
on every countenance:—He daily meets
with people who inform him of his faults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
without ceremony or circumlocution.—He
perceives that nobody cares for his bad humour
or caprice, and very naturally concludes
that he had best correct his temper.—He
finds that he is apt to be neglected in
company, and that the only remedy for this
inconveniency will be the rendering himself
agreeable.—He loves affluence, distinction,
and admiration, as well as the rich and
great; but becomes fully convinced that he
can never obtain even the shadow of them,
otherwise than by useful and ornamental
acquirements. The truth of those precepts,
which is proved by rhetoric and syllogism
to the boy of fortune, is experimentally
felt by him who has no fortune; and
the difference which this makes, is infinite.</p>

<p>So that the son of a gentleman of moderate
fortune has a probability of knowing
more of the world at the age of sixteen, and
of having a juster notion of people’s sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of him, than a youth of very high
rank at a much more advanced age; for it
is very difficult for any person to find out
that he is despised while he continues to be
flattered.</p>

<p>So far, therefore, from being surprised
that dissipation, weakness and ignorance,
are so prevalent among those who are born
to great fortunes and high rank, we ought
to be astonished to see so great a number of
men of virtue, diligence and genius among
them as there is. And if the number be
proportionably greater in England than in
any other country, which I believe is the
case, this must proceed from the impartial
discipline of our public schools; and the
equitable treatment which boys of the
greatest rank receive from their comrades.
Sometimes the natural, manly sentiments
they acquire from their school companions,
serve as an antidote against the childish, sophistical
notions with which weak or designing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
men endeavour to inspire them in
after-life.</p>

<p>The nature of the British constitution
contributes also to form a greater number of
men of talents among the wealthy and the
great, than are to be found in other countries;
because it opens a wider field for ambition
than any other government;—and
ambition excites those exertions which produce
talents.</p>

<p>But, continued I, you must acknowledge
that it would be improper to form a judgment
of the English genius, by samples
taken from men who have greater temptations
to indolence, and fewer spurs to application
than others.</p>

<p>My disputant still contested the point, and
asserted that high birth gave a native dignity
and elevation to the mind;—that distinctions
and honours were originally introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
into families by eminent abilities
and great virtues;—that when a man of illustrious
birth came into a company, or
even when his name was mentioned, this
naturally raised a recollection of the great
actions and shining qualities of the eminent
person who had first acquired those honours;—that
a consciousness of this must
naturally stimulate the present possessor to
imitate the virtues of his ancestors;—that
his degenerating would subject him to the
highest degree of censure, as the world
could not, without indignation, behold indolence
and vice adorned with the rewards
of activity and virtue.</p>

<p>I might have disputed this assertion, that
honours and titles are always the rewards of
virtue; and could have produced abundance
of instances of the opposite proposition. But
I allowed that they often were so, and that
hereditary honours in a family always ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to have, and sometimes had, the effect which
he supposed: but these concessions being
made in their fullest extent, still he would
do injustice to the English, by forming a
judgment of their national character from
what he had observed of the temper, manners,
and genius of those Englishmen with
whom he had been acquainted in foreign
countries; because three-fourths of them
were, in all probability, men of fortune,
without having family or high birth to boast
of; so that they had the greatest inducements
to indolence, without possessing the
motives to virtuous exertions, which influence
people of high rank.—For, though
it rarely happened in other countries, it was
very common in England for men of all the
various professions and trades to accumulate
very great fortunes, which, at their death,
falling to their sons, these young men,
without having had a suitable education,
immediately set up for gentlemen, and run
over Europe in the characters of Milords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Anglois, game, purchase pictures, mutilated
statues and mistresses, to the astonishment
of all beholders: And, conscious of
the blot in their escutcheon, they think it is
incumbent on them to wash it out, and
make up for the impurity of their blood,
by plunging deeper into the ocean of extravagance
than is necessary for a man of hereditary
fashion.</p>

<p>Here our conversation ended, and the
gentleman promised that he would abide by
the idea he had formed of the English nation
from the works of Milton, Locke and
Newton, and the characters of Raleigh,
Hambden, and Sidney.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LI">LETTER LI.</h2>

<p class="right">Frankfort.</p>

<p>Among the remarkable things in
Frankfort the inns may be reckoned.
Two in particular, the Emperor and the
Red House, for cleanliness, conveniency,
and number of apartments, are superior to
any I ever saw on the continent, and vie
with our most magnificent inns in England.</p>

<p>At these, as at all other inns in Germany
and Switzerland, there is an ordinary, at
which the strangers may dine and sup. This
is called the Table d’Hôte, from the circumstance
of the landlord’s sitting at the
bottom of the table and carving the victuals.
The same name for an ordinary is still retained
in France, tho’ the landlord does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sit at the table, which was the case formerly
in that country, and still is the custom
in Germany.</p>

<p>There are no private lodgings to be had
here as in London, nor any hôtels garnis as
in Paris. Strangers therefore retain apartments
at the inn during the whole time of
their residence in any of the towns. And
travellers of every denomination in this
country under the rank of sovereign princes,
make no scruple of eating occasionally
at the table d’Hôte of the inn where they
lodge, which custom is universally followed
by strangers from every country on the
continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Many of our countrymen, however, who
despise œconomy, and hate the company of
strangers, prefer eating in their own apartments
to the table d’Hôte, or any private
table to which they may be invited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be arrogance in any body to dispute
the right which every free-born Englishman
has to follow his own inclination
in this particular: Yet when people wish to
avoid the company of strangers, it strikes
me, that they might indulge their fancy as
completely at home as abroad; and while
they continue in that humour, I cannot
help thinking that they might save themselves
the inconveniency and expence of
travelling.</p>

<p>The manners and genius of nations, it is
true, are not to be learnt at inns; nor is
the most select company to be found at public
ordinaries; yet a person of observation,
and who is fond of the study of character,
will sometimes find instruction and entertainment
at both. He there sees the inhabitants
of the country on a less ceremonious
footing than he can elsewhere, and hears
the remarks of travellers of every degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The first care of a traveller certainly
should be, to form an acquaintance and some
degree of intimacy with the principal people
in every place where he intends to reside;—to
accept invitations to their family
parties, and attend their societies;—to entertain
them at his apartments, when that
can be conveniently done, and endeavour to
acquire a just notion of their government,
customs, sentiments, and manner of living.—Those
who are fond of the study of man,
which, with all due deference to the philosophers
who prefer that of beasts, birds and
butterflies, is also a pardonable amusement,
will mix occasionally with all degrees of
people, and, when not otherwise engaged,
will not scruple to take a seat at the table
d’Hôte.</p>

<p>It is said that low people are sometimes
to be found at these ordinaries. This to be
sure is a weighty objection; but then it
should be remembered, that it is within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
bounds of possibility that men even engaged
in commerce, may have liberal minds, and
may be able to give as distinct accounts of
what is worthy of observation, as if they
had been as idle as people of the highest
fashion through the whole of their lives.
A man must have a very turgid idea of his
own grandeur, if he cannot submit, in a
foreign country, to dine at table with a
person of inferior rank; especially as he will
meet, at the same time, with others of
equal, or superior rank to himself: For all
etiquette of this nature is waved even in
Germany at the tables d’Hôtes.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the characters of men,
as they appear varied in different situations
and countries;—the study of human nature
indeed in all its forms and modifications, is
highly interesting to the mind, and worthy
the attention of the greatest man. This is
not to be perfectly attained in courts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
palaces. The investigator of nature must
visit her in humbler life, and put himself
on a level with the men whom he wishes
to know.</p>

<p>It is generally found, that those who possess
real greatness of mind, never hesitate
to overleap the obstacles, and despise the
forms, which may stand in the way of their
acquiring this useful knowledge.</p>

<p>The most powerful of all arguments
against entirely declining to appear at the
public table of the inn, is, that in this
country it is customary for the ladies themselves,
when on a journey, to eat there; and
my partiality for the table d’Hôte may
possibly be owing in some degree to my
having met, at one of them, with two of
the handsomest women that I have seen
since I have been in this country, which
abounds in female beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>There is more expression in the countenances
of French women, but the ladies in
Germany have the advantage in the fairness
of their skin and the bloom of their complexion.
They have a greater resemblance
to English women than to French; yet they
differ considerably from them both.—I do
not know how to give an idea of the various
shades of expression, which, if I mistake
not, I can distinguish in the features of the
sex in these three countries.</p>

<p>A handsome French woman, besides
the ease of her manner, has commonly a
look of cheerfulness and great vivacity.—She
appears willing to be acquainted with
you, and seems to expect that you should
address her.</p>

<p>The manner of an English woman is
not so devoid of restraint; and a stranger,
especially if he be a foreigner, may observe
a look which borders on disdain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her countenance. Even among the loveliest
features, something of a sulky air often
appears. While their beauty allures, this
in some degree checks that freedom of address
which you might use to the Frenchwoman,
and interests your vanity more, by
giving the idea of the difficulties you have
to conquer.</p>

<p>A German beauty, without the smart
air of the one, or the reserve of the other,
has generally a more placid look than
either.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LII">LETTER LII.</h2>

<p class="right">Frankfort.</p>

<p>Several individuals here are fond of
distinguishing themselves by their passion
for the fine arts, and strangers are informed,
that it is well worth while to visit
certain private collections of paintings which
are to be seen at Frankfort.</p>

<p>You know I am no connoisseur; and if
I were, should not take up your time in
describing them, or giving a criticism on
their subject. For though I have seen them,
you have not; and nothing, in my opinion,
can be more unintelligible and tiresome to
the Reader, than criticisms on paintings
which he has not seen. I shall only observe,
that as all these collections have acquired
the esteem and approbation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
proprietors, which I presume was the chief
end of their creation, they are certainly intitled
to respect from every unconcerned
spectator.—— One of them in particular
must be very valuable, on account of the
prodigious sum of money which the present
possessor was offered for it, and which
he refused as inadequate to its worth;
though the sum offered would have at once
made the gentleman easy in his circumstances,
which, I am sorry to say, is far
from being the case. This anecdote cannot
be doubted, for I had it from his own
mouth.</p>

<p>It is still more the fashion here to form
cabinets of natural curiosities. Besides the
repositories of this kind, which are to be
seen at the courts of the princes, many individuals
all over Germany have Museums
in their houses, and strangers cannot pay
their court better, than by requesting permission
to see them. This would be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
easy piece of politeness, if the stranger were
allowed to take a view, and walk away
when he thought proper. But the misfortune
is, that the proprietor attends on
these occasions, and gives the history of
every piece of ore, petrifaction, fossil-wood,
and monster that is in the collection. And
as this lecture is given gratis, he assumes
the right of making it as long as he pleases:
so that requesting a sight of a private collection
of natural curiosities, is a more serious
matter than people are aware of.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— has brought himself
into a scrape, out of which I imagine
it will be difficult to extricate him. Being
unacquainted with the trouble which these
gentlemen give themselves on such occasions,
he has expressed an inclination to
three or four virtuosi to see their cabinets.
I attended him on his first visitation yesterday.
The gentleman made an unusual
exertion to please his Grace. He said, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fully convinced of his taste for natural
philosophy, in which people of his high
rank were never deficient, he would therefore
take pleasure to explain every particular
in the collection with the greatest deliberation.
He had kept himself disengaged
the whole forenoon on purpose, and had
given orders not to be interrupted. He
then descanted on each particular in the
collection, with such minuteness and perseverance,
as completely satiated His Grace’s
curiosity, and gave him such a knowledge
of earths, crystals, agates, pyrites, marcasites,
petrifactions, metals, semi-metals,
&amp;c. &amp;c. as will, I dare swear, serve him
for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class="right">Cassel.</p>

<p>I began this letter at Frankfort, not suspecting
that our departure would be so sudden.
But as the day approached on which
we had been promised the sight of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cabinet of curiosities, I found the D——’s
impatience to be gone increase every moment.
So sending our apology to the proprietors
of two or three which he had asked
permission to visit, we passed one day
with Madame de Barkhause’s family, and
another with Mr. Gogle’s, and then bidding
a hasty adieu to our other acquaintances
at Frankfort, we set out for this
place. We slept the first night at Marburg,
and on the second, about midnight, arrived
at Cassel.</p>

<p>As the ground is quite covered with snow,
the roads bad, and the posts long, we were
obliged to take six horses for each chaise,
which, after all, in some places moved no
faster than a couple of hearses. The D——
bore this with wonderful serenity, contemplating
the happy evasion he had made
from the cabinets at Frankfort. A slave
who had escaped from the mines could not
have shown greater satisfaction. His good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
humour remained proof against all the
phlegm and obstinacy of the German postillions,
of which one who has not travelled
in the extremity of the winter, and when
the roads are covered with snow, through
this country, can form no idea.</p>

<p>The contrast of character between the
French and Germans is strongly illustrated
in the behaviour of the postillions of the
two countries.</p>

<p>A French postillion is generally either
laughing, or fretting, or singing, or swearing,
all the time he is on the road. If a
hill or a bad road oblige him to go slow,
he will of a sudden fall a cracking his whip
above his head for a quarter of an hour together,
without rhyme or reason; for he
knows the horses cannot go a bit faster, and
he does not intend they should. All this
noise and emotion, therefore, means nothing;
and proceeds entirely from that abhorrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of quiet which every Frenchman sucks in
with his mother’s milk.</p>

<p>A German postillion, on the contrary,
drives four horses with all possible tranquillity.
He neither sings, nor frets, nor
laughs: he only smokes;—and when he
comes near a narrow defile, he sounds his
trumpet to prevent any carriage from entering
at the other end till he has got through.
If you call to him to go faster, he turns
about, looks you in the face, takes his pipe
from his mouth, and says, Yaw, Mynher;—yaw,
yaw; and then proceeds exactly in
the same pace as before. He is no way affected
whether the road be good or bad;
whether it rains, or shines, or snows:—And
he seems to be totally regardless of the
people whom he drives, and equally callous
to their reproach or applause. He has one
object of which he never loses sight, which
is, to conduct your chaise and the contents
from one post to another, in the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he thinks best for himself and the horses.
And unless his pipe goes out (in which case
he strikes his flint and rekindles it), he
seems not to have another idea during the
whole journey.</p>

<p>Your best course is to let him take his
own way at first, for it will come to that at
last.—All your noise and bluster are vain.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LIII">LETTER LIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Cassel.</p>

<p>The attention and civilities which are
paid to the D—— of H—— by this court,
have induced us to remain longer than we
intended at our arrival.</p>

<p>As you seem curious to know how we
pass our time, and the style of living here,
I shall give you a sketch of one day, which,
with little variation, may give you an idea
of all the rest.</p>

<p>We generally employ the morning and
forenoon in study. We go to the palace
about half an hour before dinner is served,
where we find all the officers who have
been invited, assembled in a large room.
The Landgrave soon appears, and continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
conversing with the company till his
consort arrives with the princess Charlotte,
and such ladies as they have thought proper
to invite.</p>

<p>The company then walk to the dining
parlour, where there are about thirty covers
every day, and the same number in a
room adjoining. The doors being left open
between these apartments, the whole forms
in a manner but one company. The strangers,
and such officers as are not under the
rank of colonel, dine at their Highnesses
table.</p>

<p>The repast continues about two hours,
during which the conversation is carried
on with some little appearance of constraint,
and rather in a low voice, except
when either of their Highnesses speaks to
any person seated at a little distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner the company returns to the
room where they first assembled. In this
they remain till the Landgrave retires,
which he usually does within about a quarter
of an hour. Soon after the company
separates till seven in the evening, when
they again assemble.</p>

<p>The Landgrave plays constantly at Cavaniolle,
a kind of lottery, where no address
or attention is requisite, and which
needs hardly interrupt conversation. It
requires about a dozen players to make his
party.</p>

<p>The Landgravine plays at Quadrille, and
chooses her own party every night.—Other
card-tables are set in the adjoining rooms,
for the conveniency of any who choose to
play. The gaming continues about a couple
of hours. The Landgrave then salutes
her Highness on both cheeks, and retires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to his own apartments, while she and the
rest of the company go to supper. At this
repast there is less formality, and of consequence
more ease and gaiety, than at
dinner.</p>

<p>When her Highness rises from table,
most part of the company attend her up
stairs to a spacious anti-chamber, where she
remains conversing a few minutes, and then
retires.</p>

<p>These general forms are sometimes varied
by a concert in the Landgrave’s apartments.
There are also certain days of
Gala, which are only distinguished by the
company’s being more numerous, and better
dressed, than usual: two circumstances
which do not add a vast deal to the pleasure
of the entertainment.</p>

<p>During the Carnival, there were two or
three masquerades. On these occasions the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
court assemble about six in the evening, the
men being all in Dominos, and the ladies
in their usual dress, or with the addition
of a few fanciful ornaments, according to
the particular taste of each.</p>

<p>They amuse themselves with cards and
conversation till the hour of supper. During
this interval, a gentleman of the court
carries a parcel of tickets in his hat, equal
to the number of men in company. These
are presented to the ladies, each of whom
draws one. Tickets in the same manner
are presented to the men, who take one a-piece,
which they keep till the card-playing
is finished.</p>

<p>The officer then calls number One, upon
which the couple who are possessed of
that number come forward, and the gentleman
leads the lady into the supper-room,
sits by her, and is her partner for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the rest of the evening. In the same manner
every other Number is called.</p>

<p>After supper, all the company put on
their masks. Her Highness is led into
the masquerade room. The rest follow,
each lady being handed by her partner.
The Landgravine and her partner walk to
the upper end of the room.—The next
couple stop at a small distance below
them;—the third, next to the second, and
so on till this double file reaches from the
top to the bottom of the hall. If there
are any supernumeraries, they must retire
to the sides.—From this arrangement you
expect a country dance:—a minuet however
is intended—the music begins, and
all the maskers on the floor, consisting of
twenty or thirty couple, walk a minuet
together. This, which is rather a confused
affair, being over, every body sits
down, the Landgravine excepted, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
generally dances nine or ten minuets successively
with as many different gentlemen.
She then takes her seat till the rest of the
company have danced minuets, which being
over, the cotillons and country-dances begin,
and continue till four or five in the
morning.</p>

<p>Her Highness is a very beautiful woman,
graceful in her person, and of a gay and
sprightly character. She is in danger of
growing corpulent, an inconveniency not
uncommon in Germany, but which she
endeavours to retard by using a great deal
of exercise.</p>

<p>Besides the company who sup at court,
the rooms were generally crowded with
masks from the town, some of whom are
in fancy-dresses, and keep themselves concealed
all the time. And although those
who came from the court are known
when they enter the masquerade rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
many of them slip out afterwards, change
their dress, and return to amuse themselves,
by teasing their friends in their
assumed characters, as is usual at masquerades.</p>

<p>The country-dances are composed of all
persons promiscuously, who incline to join
in them.—Two women of pleasure, who
had come to pass the Carnival at Cassel in
the exercise of their profession, and were
well known to many of the officers, danced
every masquerade night in the country-dance,
which her Highness led down; for
the mask annihilates ceremony, puts every
body on a footing, and not unfrequently,
while it conceals the face most effectually,
serves so much the more to discover the real
character and inclinations of the wearer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LIV">LETTER LIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Cassel.</p>

<p>Next to the Electors of the Empire,
the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel is one
of the greatest Princes in Germany; and
even of those, the electors of Bohemia,
Bavaria, Saxony, and Hanover, only are
richer and more powerful than he. His
country is in general hilly, with a great
deal of wood, but interspersed with fertile
vallies and corn-fields. The large subsidies
this court received from Britain during the
two last wars, with what is given in the
time of peace, by way of retaining fee, have
greatly contributed to the present flourishing
state of its finances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The reigning Prince forsook the Protestant
faith about twenty years ago, and
made a public profession of the Roman
Catholic religion, in the lifetime of the
late Landgrave, his father. This gave
great uneasiness to the old Prince, and
alarmed his subjects, who are all Protestants.</p>

<p>The states of the Landgraviate were assembled
on this important occasion, and
such measures taken as were judged necessary
to maintain the religion and constitution
of the country, against any future attempt
to subvert them. The Hereditary
Prince was excluded from all share in the
education of his sons, who were put under
the tuition of the Princess Mary of Great
Britain, his first wife, living at that time
separate from her husband. The eldest
son, upon his father’s accession to the
Landgraviate, was put in possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
county of Hanau; so that the inhabitants
have felt no inconveniency from the change
of their Prince’s religion. And as he
himself has reaped no earthly advantage,
either in point of honour or profit, by his
conversion, it is presumable, that his Highness’s
hopes are now limited to the rewards
which may await him in another world.</p>

<p>This Prince keeps on foot 16000, men
in time of peace, disciplined according to
the Prussian plan, the Landgrave himself
having the rank of Field Marshal in the
Prussian army. The Prince is fond of
exercising them; but not having a house
on purpose, as the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt
has, he takes that amusement when,
the weather is very bad in the dining-room
of his palace, where I have frequently
seen two or three hundred of the
first battalion of guards perform their
manœuvres with all possible dexterity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince of Saxe-Gotha, brother to
the late Princess of Wales, has a regiment
in the Landgrave’s service, and resides at
Cassel.</p>

<p>The person who has the chief management
in military affairs, is General Scliven,
a man of an exceeding just and accurate
understanding, which he has finely
cultivated by reading and reflection.</p>

<p>I have the happiness to be intimately
acquainted with many other officers in this
service.—An open manner, and undesigning
civility, distinguish the German character;
qualities which naturally banish reserve,
and inspire confidence. And what
makes the conversation of these gentlemen
still more agreeable and interesting to me,
is the justice they seem fond of rendering
to the bravery of the British troops with
whom they served. They always mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the names of Granby, Waldgrave, and
Kingsley, with the highest encomiums,
and speak with affectionate regard of some
officers with whom they were more intimately
acquainted, particularly Mr. Keith,
now at Vienna, and Colonel John Maxwell,
whom they applaud as one of the
bravest and most active officers that served
in the allied army; and seem fond of mentioning
instances of the amazing intrepidity
of the British grenadiers whom he commanded.</p>

<p>Besides those actually in the Landgrave’s
service, there are some other persons of
note who reside at Cassel. I sometimes
pass an afternoon with old General Zastrow,
who had the command of the garrison of
Schweidnitz, when it was surprised by the
Austrian general Laudohn.</p>

<p>If you recollect, that important place
had been taken from the Prussians in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
year 1757, by Count Nadasti. It was
blockaded by the King of Prussia in the
winter of that same year, and surrendered
to him in spring 1758, after one half of
the garrison had fallen in defending the
place. In the year 1761, Laudohn retook
it almost in sight of the Prussian monarchy
by the most brilliant coup-de-main that
perhaps ever was struck.</p>

<p>The King’s army and Laudohn’s were
both in the neighbourhood of Schweidnitz.
The latter could not attempt a regular
siege, while he was watched by such
an enterprising enemy. But observing that
the King had moved at a greater distance
than usual from the town, and knowing
that more than one half of the garrison had
been drafted, he resolved on an enterprise
as bold as it was sagacious. One morning
early this vigilant commander, taking the
advantage of a thick fog, marched his army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to the town, of Schweidnitz in four
divisions. Scaling-ladders were applied
to the ramparts, and some of the Austrians
had actually entered the town,
before they were observed by the centinels.</p>

<p>The garrison, being at last roused, attacked
the assailants in a furious manner.—The
confusion was increased by
the blowing up of a powder magazine,
which destroyed great numbers on both
sides. The Governor was taken prisoner,
fighting sword in hand on the ramparts,
and the town surrendered.</p>

<p>This exploit established the reputation of
Laudohn, while poor Zastrow, according
to the usual fate of the unfortunate, became
a prey to the calumny of the unfeeling
and ungenerous. He demanded a trial
by a court martial.—The King said there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was no occasion for that, as he did not accuse
him of any crime.—But he did not
judge it expedient to employ him in any
command after this misfortune.</p>

<p>I have heard the old man relate all the
particulars of that affair, and the account
he gave has been confirmed to me by
officers well informed, and unconnected
with him.</p>

<p>A company of French comedians are
lately arrived here, which forms a new
resource for the court. They remain six
weeks, or two months. The Landgrave
pays them a stipulated sum for acting twice
a week during that time; and they have
scarcely any emolument beside; for the
inhabitants of Cassel, who are Calvinists,
shew no great passion for dramatic entertainments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The playhouse is neat, though small.
The front gallery, with a convenient room
behind, is appropriated to the court.
When the Prince or Princess stands up,
whether between the acts, or in the time
of the representation, all the audience, pit,
box, and gallery, immediately arise; and
remain in a standing posture till their sovereign
sit down.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of these players, the
court has been uncommonly brilliant, and
the Gala days more frequent. Yesterday
was a very splendid one. I then observed
in the drawing-room, two persons, neither
of whom is a Hessian, saluting each other
with great politeness and apparent regard.
A little after, one of them touched
my shoulder, and, pointing to the other,
whispered in my ear,—Prenez garde, Monsieur,
de cet homme; c’est un grand coquin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The other within a few minutes came
to me, saying, Croyez vous, Monsieur, que
vous puissiez reconnoitre un fou si je vous
le montrois?—Le voilà, added he, showing
the person who had whispered me before.</p>

<p>I have been since told, by those who
know both, that each had hit exactly upon
the other’s character.</p>

<p>This little trait I have mentioned merely
on account of its singularity, and to show
you how very different the manners of this
court, and the sentiments of the courtiers
here with regard to each other, are from
those at St. James’s.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LV">LETTER LV.</h2>

<p class="right">Cassel.</p>

<p>The city of Cassel is situated on the
river Fulda. It consists of an old and
new town. The former is the largest and
most irregular. The new town is well
built; and there, as you may believe, the
nobility and officers of the court have their
houses. The streets are beautiful, but not
over-crowded with inhabitants.</p>

<p>Besides the large chateau in the town of
Cassel, which is the Landgrave’s winter
residence, he has several villas and castles
in different parts of his dominions. Immediately
without the town, there is a very
beautiful building, in which he dwells for
the most part of the summer The apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
there are neat and commodious, some
of them adorned with antique statues of
considerable value.</p>

<p>None of the rooms are spacious enough
to admit of exercising any considerable
number of the troops within their walls;
but his Highness sometimes indulges in
this favourite recreation on the top of this
villa, which has a flat roof, most convenient
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Around this are some noble parks and
gardens, with a very complete orangery.
There is also a menagerie, with a considerable
collection of curious animals. I
saw there a very fine lioness, which has
lately lost her husband—an elephant—three
camels in fine condition, one of them milk-white,
the other two grey, and much
taller than the elephant;—an African deer,
a fierce and lively animal, with a skin beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
spotted;—a very tall rain-deer—several
leopards—a bear, and a great variety
of monkies.—The collection of birds is
still more complete, a great many of which
are from the East Indies.</p>

<p>In the academy of arts, which is situated
in the new town, are some valuable antiques,
and other curiosities, among which
is a St. John in Mosaic, done after a picture
of Raphaël’s, with the following inscription
below it:</p>

<p class="center">IMAGINEM S. JOHANNES<br />

<p>But this art of copying paintings in Mosaic
work, I understand has of late been
brought to a much greater degree of perfection
at Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In the vestibule is placed the trunk of a
laurel tree, with this inscription on the
wall behind it.</p>

<p class="center">QUÆ<br />

<p>They also show a sword, which was
consecrated by the Pope, and sent to one
of the Princes of this family at his setting
out on an expedition to the Holy Land.
What havoc this sacred weapon made
among the infidels I cannot say.—It has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
very venerable appearance for a sword, and
yet seems little the worse for wear.</p>

<p>Near the old chateau, and a little to one
side, is a colonade of small pillars lately
built, and intended as an ornament to the
ancient castle, though in a very different
style of architecture. The slimness of their
form appears the more remarkable on
account of their vicinity to this Gothic
structure.</p>

<p>Some time since, a mountebank came to
Cassel, who, besides many other wonderful
feats, pretended that he could swallow
and digest stones. A Hessian officer walking
before the chateau with an English
gentleman, who then happened to be at
Cassel, asked him, What he thought of
the fine new colonade?—It is very fine indeed,
replied the stranger; but if you wish
it to be durable, you ought to take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not to allow the mountebank to walk this
way before breakfast.</p>

<p>Nothing in the country of Hesse is more
worthy the admiration of travellers, than
the Gothic temple and cascade at Wasenstein.
There was originally at this place
an old building, which was used by the
Princes of this family as a kind of hunting-house.
It is situated near the bottom of
a high mountain, and has been enlarged
and improved at different times. But the
present Landgrave’s grandfather, who was
a Prince of equal taste and magnificence,
formed, upon the face of the mountain
opposite to this house, a series of artificial
cataracts, cascades, and various kinds of
water-works, in the noblest style that can
be imagined.</p>

<p>The principal cascades are in the middle,
and on each side are stairs of large black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stones of a flinty texture, brought from a
rock at a considerable distance. Each of
these stairs consists of eight hundred steps,
leading from the bottom to the summit of
the mountain; and when the works are
allowed to play, the water flowing over
them forms two continued chains of
smaller cascades. At convenient distances,
as you ascend, are four platforms, with a
spacious bason in each; also grottos and
caves ornamented with shell-work, statues
of Naiads, and sea divinities.—One grotto
in particular, called the grotto of Neptune
and Amphitrite, is happily imagined, and
well executed.</p>

<p>The water rushes from the summit of
this mountain in various shapes:—Sometimes
in detached cascades, sometimes in
large sheets like broad crystalline mirrors;
at one place, it is broken by a rock consisting
of huge stones, artificially placed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that purpose.—There are also fountains,
which eject the water in columns of five
or six inches diameter to a considerable
height.</p>

<p>All this must have a very brilliant effect
when viewed from the bottom. This
sight, however, I did not enjoy; for there
has been a continued frost ever since we
have been at Cassel; and when I visited
Wasenstein, the fields were covered with
snow, which did not prevent my going to
the top, though it made the ascent by the
flairs exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>On the highest part of the mountain, a
Gothic temple is built, and upon the top
of that an obelisk, which is crowned by
a colossal statue of Hercules leaning on his
club, in the attitude of the Farnese Hercules.
This figure is of copper, and thirty
feet in height. There is a staircase within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the club by which a man may ascend, and
have a view of the country from a window
at the top.</p>

<p>Wasenstein, upon the whole, is infinitely
the noblest work of the kind I ever saw.
I have been allured, there is nothing equal
to it in Europe. It has not the air of a
modern work, but rather conveys the idea
of Roman magnificence.</p>

<p>We think of leaving this within a few
days for Brunswick.—I shall not close my
letter till we get to Gottingen, where we
may probably stay a short time.</p>

<p>P. S. The D. and I took our leave of the
Court and our friends yesterday, and actually
set out from Cassel this morning; but
finding the roads entirely overflowed by the
extraordinary swelling of the Fulda, we
were obliged to return. A great thaw for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
some days past dissolving the snow and ice,
has occasioned this swelling, and rendered
the roads impassable.</p>

<p>After taking leave we could not appear
again at court, but dined at one of the
messes with the officers.—From this party I
am just returned, and finding it uncertain
when we may get to Gottingen, I send this
to-night.</p>

<p>As soon as the roads were passable, we
left Cassel, and arrived, not without
difficulty and some risk, at Munden, a
town situated in a vale, where the Fulda,
being joined by another river, takes the
name of the Weser.</p>

<p>This town seems to run some danger
from inundations. The road, for a considerable
way before we entered it, and
the streets nearest the river, were still
overflowed when we passed.</p>

<p>We went on the same night to Gottingen,
an exceedingly neat and well-built
town, situated in a beautiful country.
The university founded here by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
George the Second has a considerable reputation.
We made but a short stay at
Gottingen, and arrived about a month since
at Brunswick.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— had been expected
here for some time, and was received by
this court with every mark of attention
and regard. He was pressed to accept of
apartments within the palace, which he
thought proper to decline. We sleep
every night at private lodgings, but may
be said to live at court, as we constantly
dine, pass the evening, and sup there,
except two days in every week that we
dine with the Hereditary Prince and Princess
at their apartments.</p>

<p>The family of Brunswick Wolfenbuttle
derives not greater lustre from its antiquity,
from having given empresses to Germany,
and from having a younger branch on the
throne of Britain, than from some living
characters now belonging to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The reigning Duke has that style of
conversation, those manners and dispositions,
which, in an inferior station of life,
would acquire him the character of a sensible,
worthy gentleman.</p>

<p>The Duchess is the favourite sister of the
King of Prussia. She is fond of study, and
particularly addicted to metaphysical inquiries,
which, happily, have not shaken,
but confirmed her belief in Christianity.</p>

<p>The military fame and public character
of Duke Ferdinand are known to all Europe.—In
private life, he is of a ceremonious
politeness, splendid in his manner of
living, attentive even to the minutiæ of his
toilet, and fond of variety and magnificence
in dress.</p>

<p>He has lived constantly at his brother’s
court since the D—— of H—— came to Brunswick;
but he generally passes the summer
in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hereditary Prince served under his
uncle during the last war, and commanded
detached parties of the army with various
success. His activity, courage, and thirst
of glory, were always conspicuous; but
his youthful ardour has been since mellowed
by time, study, and reflection; and
if he should again appear in the field as
a general, it is imagined that he will be as
much distinguished for prudence, policy,
and judgment, as he ever was for spirit and
enterprize. He has at present the rank of
Lieutenant-General in the King of Prussia’s
service, and the command of the garrison
at Halberstadt.</p>

<p>I say nothing of his Princess:—Her
open cheerful character is well known in
England, and her affection for her native
country is in no degree diminished by absence.</p>

<p>The Prince Leopold is a very amiable
young man. He seems much attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the D—— of H——, with whom he lives
on an intimate and friendly footing.</p>

<p>His sister, the Princess Augusta, is greatly
beloved by every body, on account of her
obliging temper and excellent disposition.</p>

<p>These illustrious persons always dine and
sup together, except two days in the week,
as I have already said. With them the
officers of the court, and the strangers who
are invited, make a company of about
twenty or thirty at table.</p>

<p>In the evening the assembly is more numerous.
There is a large table for Vingt-un,
the Dutchess preferring this game,
because a great number of people may be
engaged in it together. The reigning
Duke and Prince Ferdinand always join
in this game.</p>

<p>The Hereditary Princess forms a Quadrille
party for herself: Her husband never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
plays at all. The whole is intended merely
for pastime, all kinds of gaming being discouraged.
The Dutchess in particular always
puts a very moderate stake on her
cards.—A man must have very bad luck
to lose above twenty pistoles in an evening;
so we are in no danger from gaming
while at this court.</p>

<p>One wing of the palace is occupied by
the Hereditary Prince’s family. He has
at present three sons and as many daughters,
all of the fair complexion, which
distinguishes every branch of the Brunswick
line.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I accompanied Prince
Leopold and the D—— of H—— on a visit
to Duke Ferdinand, who was then at his
house in the country, about six miles from
this place. In that retreat he passes the
greatest part of his time. He is fond of
gardening, and is now employed in laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
out and dressing the ground, in what is
called the English taste.</p>

<p>His Serene Highness conducted the D——
round all his park, and shewed him his
plans and improvements. The greatest
obstacle to the completely beautifying this
place, arises from the surface of the country
being a dead flat, and incapable of
great variety.</p>

<p>The house is surrounded by a Fossé,
and contains a great number of apartments.
The walls of every room are
hung with prints, from the roof to within
two feet of the floor. Perhaps there is
not so complete a collection of framed ones
in any private house or palace in the
world. While Prince Ferdinand played
at Billiards with the D—— of H——, I
continued with Prince Leopold examining
these prints, and could scarcely recollect
a good one that I did not find here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>His Highness said it was equally difficult
and expensive to have a collection of
good paintings, and nothing could be
more paltry than a bad one: he had
therefore taken the resolution to adorn his
house with what he certainly could have
good of its kind; and next to fine pictures,
he thought fine prints the most amusing
of all ornaments. But, added he, with
a smile, every tolerable room is now perfectly
covered, and I have lately received
a reinforcement of prints from England,
which will oblige me to build new apartments
to place them in, puisque je suis
toujours accoutumé à donner un poste honorable
aux Anglois.</p>

<p>The company had been invited to breakfast;
but the repast was a very magnificent
dinner, served a little earlier than
usual. There was only six persons at table;
but the number of attendants might
without difficulty have served a company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of thirty. The Prince, who is always in
the utmost degree polite, was on this occasion
remarkably affable and gay. He
called toasts after the English custom, and
began himself by naming General Conway;
he afterwards gave Sir H. Clinton,
and continued to toast some British officer
as often as it came to his turn.—You may
believe it afforded me satisfaction to have
had an opportunity of observing a little
of the private life of a person who has
acted so conspicuous a part on the theatre
of Europe.</p>

<p>As he has not returned to the Prussian
service, and seems to enjoy rural amusements,
and the conversation of a few friends,
it is thought he will not again take a part
in public affairs, but for the rest of his
life repose, in this retreat, on the laurels
he gathered in such abundance during the
last war.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LVII">LETTER LVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Brunswick.</p>

<p>The town of Brunswick is situated in
a plain, on the banks of the Ocker.
The houses in general are old, but many
new buildings have been erected of late,
and the city acquires fresh beauty every
day.</p>

<p>Fortifications have been the cause of
much calamity to many towns in Germany,
having served not to defend them, but
rather to attract the vengeance of enemies.
For this reason, Cassel, and some other
towns, which were formerly fortified, are
now dismantled. But the fortifications at
Brunswick were of great utility last war,
and on one occasion they saved the town
from being pillaged, and afforded Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Frederick, who is now in the Prussian service,
an opportunity of performing an action,
which, I imagine, gave him more
joy than twenty victories. This happened
in the year 1761, soon after the
battle of Kirch Denkern, when Duke Ferdinand
protected Hanover, not by conducting
his army into that country, and defending
it directly, as the enemy seemed to
expert, and probably wished; but by diversion,
attacking with strong detachments,
commanded by the Hereditary Prince, their
magazines in Hesse, and thus drawing their
attention from Hanover to that quarter.</p>

<p>While the Duke lay encamped at Willhemsthall,
watching the motions of Broglio’s
army, the Marechal being greatly
superior in numbers, sent a body of 20,000
men under Prince Xavier of Saxony, who
took possession of Wolfenbuttle, and soon
after invested Brunswick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Ferdinand, anxious to save his
native city, ventured to detach 5000 of his
army, small as it was, under his nephew,
Frederick, assisted by General Luckener,
with orders to harass the enemy, and endeavour
to raise the siege. The young
Prince, while on his march, sent a soldier
with a letter to the Governor, which was
wrapped round a bullet, and which the
soldier was to swallow in case of his being
taken by the enemy.—He had the good
fortune to get safe into the town.—The
letter apprised the commander of the garrison
of the Prince’s approach, and particularised
the night and hour when he expected
to be at a certain place near the
town, requiring him to favour his entrance.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night appointed,
the Prince fell suddenly on the enemy’s
cavalry, who, unsuspicious of his approach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
were encamped carelessly within a mile of
the town. They were immediately dispersed,
and spread such an alarm among
the infantry, that they also retreated with
considerable loss.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the young Prince
entered Brunswick, amidst the acclamations
of his fellow-citizens, whom he had
relieved from the horrors of a siege.—The
Hereditary Prince having destroyed the
French magazines in Hesse, had been recalled
by his uncle, and ordered to attempt
the relief of Brunswick. While he was
advancing with all possible speed, and had
got within a few leagues of the town, he
received the news of the siege being raised.
On his arrival at his father’s palace, he
found his brother Frederick at table, entertaining
the French officers, who had been
taken prisoners the preceding night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The academy of Brunswick has been
new-modelled, and the plan of education
improved, by the attention, and under
the patronage, of the Hereditary Prince.
Students now resort to this academy from
many parts of Germany; and there are generally
some young gentlemen from Britain,
who are sent to be educated here.</p>

<p>Such of them as are intended for a military
life, will not find so many advantages
united at any other place on the continent,
as at the academy of Brunswick.
They will here be under the protection of
a family partial to the British nation;—every
branch of science is taught by matters
of known abilities;—the young students
will see garrison-duty regularly performed,
and may, by the interest of the
Prince, obtain liberty to attend the reviews
of the Prussian troops at Magdeburg
and Berlin:—They will have few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
temptations to expence, in a town where
they can see no examples of extravagance,—have
few opportunities of dissipation,
and none of gross debauchery.</p>

<p>I passed a day lately at Wolfenbuttle,
which is also a fortified city, the ancient
residence of this family.—The public library
here is reckoned one of the most
complete in Germany, and contains many
curious manuscripts. They showed us
some letters of Luther, and other original
pieces in that reformer’s own handwriting.</p>

<p>Having dined with Colonel Riedesel,
who commands a regiment of cavalry in
this town, I returned by Saltzdahlen. This
is the only palace I ever saw built almost
entirely of wood. There are, nevertheless,
some very magnificent apartments in it,
and a great gallery of pictures, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
which are allowed by the connoisseurs to
be excellent. I will not invade the province
of these gentlemen, by presuming
to give my opinion of the merits or defects
of the pictures, though I have often
heard those who are as ignorant as myself,
decide upon the interesting subject of
painting, in the most dogmatic manner.
The terms Contour, Attitude, Casting of
Draperies, Charging, Costumé, Passion,
Manner, Groupe, Out-line, Chiaro Scuro,
Harmony, and Repose, flowed from their
tongues, with a volubility that commanded
the admiration of all those who
could not discover, that in the liberal
use of these terms consisted all those gentlemen’s
taste and knowledge of the fine
arts.</p>

<p>Conscious of my ignorance in the mysteries
of connoisseurship, I say nothing of
the pictures, and presume only to give my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
opinion, that the gallery which contains
them is a very noble room, being two
hundred feet long, fifty broad, and forty
high.</p>

<p>In this palace there is also a cabinet of
china porcelain, containing, as we were
told, seven or eight thousand pieces;—and
in another smaller cabinet, we were shewn
a collection of coarse plates, valuable only
on account of their having been painted
after designs of Raphaël.</p>

<p>The country about Brunswick is agreeable.
I was particularly pleased to see
some gentlemen’s seats near this town; a
sight very rare in Germany, where, if you
avoid towns and courts, you may travel
over a great extent of country, without
perceiving houses for any order of men between
the Prince and the Peasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>I spent yesterday very agreeably fourteen
miles from Brunswick, at the house of
Mr. de Westphalen. This gentleman attended
Duke Ferdinand during the late
war in the character of his private secretary;
an office which he executed entirely
to the satisfaction of that Prince,
whose friendship and confidence he still
retains.</p>

<p>Mr. de Westphalen has written the history
of those memorable campaigns, in which
his patron had the command of the allied
army, and baffled all the efforts of France
in Westphalia. Though this work has
been finished long since, the publication
has hitherto been delayed for political
reasons. It is to appear however
at some future period, and is said to be a
masterly performance. Indeed, one would
naturally suppose this from the remarkable
acuteness and sagacity of the author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
who was present at the scenes he describes,
and knew the secret intentions of the General,
whose assistance he has probably had
in finishing the work.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LVIII">LETTER LVIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Brunswick.</p>

<p>We have had some masquerade balls
here of late.—The Court do not go
in procession to these as at Cassel.—Those
who chuse to attend, go separately when
they find it convenient.</p>

<p>There is a gallery in the masquerade
room for the reigning family, where they
sometimes sit without masks, and amuse
themselves by looking at the dancers. But
in general they go masked, and mix in
an easy and familiar manner with the company.</p>

<p>I am not surprised that the Germans,
especially those of high rank, are fond of
masquerades, being so much harassed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ceremony and form, and cramped by the
distance which birth throws between people
who may have a mutual regard for each
other. I imagine they are glad to seize
every opportunity of assuming the mask
and domino, that they may taste the pleasures
of familiar conversation and social
mirth.—— In company with the D—— of
H——, I once had the honour of dining
at the house of a general officer. His
sister did the honours of the table; and on
the Duke’s expressing his surprise that he
never had seen her at court, he was told
she could not possibly appear there, because
she was not noble. This lady, however,
was visited at home by the Sovereign, and
every family of distinction, all of whom
regretted, that the established custom of
their country deprived the court of a
person whose character they valued so
highly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The General’s rank in the army was a
sufficient passport for him, but was of no
service to his sister; for this etiquette is
observed very rigidly with respect to the
natives of Germany, though it is greatly
relaxed to strangers, particularly the English,
who they imagine have less regard for
birth and title than any other nation.</p>

<p>Public diversions of every kind are now
over for some time, and the Court is at
present very thin.—Duke Ferdinand resides
in the country. The Hereditary Prince
went a few days since to Halberstadt, where
he will remain at least a month, to prepare
the garrison, and his own regiment in
particular, for the grand reviews which are
soon to take place. Diligence in duty,
and application to the disciplining of the
forces, are indispensable in this service.
Without these, not all the King’s partiality
to this Prince, or his consanguinity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
could secure to him his uncle’s favour for
one day, personal talents and vigorous
exertion being the sole means of acquiring
and retaining the favour of this steady and
discerning monarch.</p>

<p>The Hereditary Princess has left Brunswick,
and is gone to Zell, and will remain
during the absence of her husband with her
sister the Queen of Denmark.</p>

<p>The young Prince, Leopold, has also
left the Court. He goes directly to Vienna,
and it is thought he intends to offer his
services to the Emperor. If proper encouragement
be given, he will go entirely
into the Austrian service. In this case, he
will probably, when a war happens, find
himself in opposition to his two brothers;
a circumstance not much regarded in Germany,
where brothers go into different services,
with as little hesitation as into different
regiments with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The strictest friendship has always subsisted
between this young man and his
sister, who has been crying almost without
intermission since he went away.</p>

<p>His mother bears this with more composure,
yet her uneasiness is easily perceived.
Independent of the absence of her son,
she is distressed at the idea of his going into
a service, where he may be obliged to
act in opposition to her brother, for whom
I find she has the greatest affection, as well
as the highest admiration.</p>

<p>I was not surprised to hear her speak of
him as the greatest man alive; but she extends
her eulogium to the qualities of his
heart, in which she is not joined by the
opinion of all the world.—She, however,
dwells particularly on this, calling him
the worthiest of men, the firmest friend,
and the kindest of brothers:—and as she
founds her opinion on her own experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
alone, she has the greatest reason to think
as she does; for, by every account, the
King has always behaved with high regard
and undeviating tenderness to her.</p>

<p>The departure of Prince Leopold has
revived this Princess’s affliction for the
untimely fate of two of her sons. One died
in the Russian camp at the end of the campaign
of 1769, in which he had served with
great distinction as a volunteer; the other
was killed in a skirmish towards the end of
the last war; having received a shot in his
throat, he died of the wound fifteen days
after, much regretted by the army, who
had formed a high idea of the rising merit
of this gallant youth.</p>

<p>He wrote a letter to his mother in the
morning of the day on which he died. In
this letter he regrets, that he should be
stopped so soon in the course of honour, and
laments that he had not been killed in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
memorable action, which would have saved
his name from oblivion, or in achieving
something worthy of the martial spirit
of his family. He expresses satisfaction,
however, that his memory would at least be
dear to some friends, and that he was certain
of living in his mother’s affections
while she should exist. He then declares
his gratitude to her for all her care and tenderness,
and concludes with these expressions,
which I translate as near as I can remember—I
wished the Dutchess to repeat
them; but it was with difficulty, and eyes
overflowing, that she pronounced them
once:—“My eyes grow dim—I can see no
longer—happy to have employed their
last light in expressing my duty to my
mother.”</p>

<p class="right">Hanover.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— having determined
to pay his respects to the
Queen of Denmark, before he left this
country, chose to make his visit while the
Hereditary Princess was with her sister.</p>

<p>I accompanied him to Zell, and next
day waited on the Count and Countess
Dean, to let them know of the D——’s
arrival, and to be informed when we could
have the honour of being presented to the
Queen. They both belong to the Princess
of Brunswick’s family, and while I was at
breakfast with them, her Royal Highness
entered the room, and gave me the information
I wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Before dinner, I returned with the Duke
to the castle, where we remained till late
in the evening. There was a concert of
music between dinner and supper, and the
Queen seemed in better spirits than could
have been expected.</p>

<p>Zell is a small town, without trade or
manufactures; the houses are old, and of
a mean appearance, yet the high courts of
appeal for all the territories of the Electoral
House of Brunswick Lunenburg are held
here; the inhabitants derive their principal
means of subsistence from this circumstance.</p>

<p>This town was severely harassed by the
French army at the beginning of the late
war, and was afterwards pillaged, in revenge
for the supposed infraction of the
treaty of Closter-Seven. The Duke de
Richlieu had his head-quarters here, when
Duke Ferdinand re-assembled the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
who had been disarmed, and dispersed, immediately
after that convention.</p>

<p>The castle is a stately building, surrounded
by a moat, and strongly fortified.
It was formerly the residence of the Dukes
of Zell, and was repaired lately by order
of the King of Great Britain for the reception
of his unfortunate sister. The apartments
are spacious and convenient, and now
handsomely furnished.</p>

<p>The officers of the Court, the Queen’s
maids of honour, and other attendants,
have a very genteel appearance, and retain
the most respectful attachment to their ill-fated
mistress. The few days we remained
at Zell, were spent entirely at Court, where
every thing seemed to be arranged in the
style of the other small German courts,
and nothing wanting to render the Queen’s
situation as comfortable as circumstances
would admit. But by far her greatest consolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
is the company and conversation
of her sister. Some degree of satisfaction
appears in her countenance while the Princess
remains at Zell; but the moment she
goes away, the Queen, as we were informed,
becomes a prey to dejection and
despondency. The Princess exerts herself
to prevent this, and devotes to her sister
all the time she can spare from the duties
she owes to her own family. Unlike
those who take the first pretext of breaking
connections which can no longer be
of advantage, this humane Princess has
displayed even more attachment to her
sister since her misfortunes, than she ever
did while the Queen was in the meridian
of her prosperity.</p>

<p>The youth, the agreeable countenance,
and obliging manners of the Queen, have
conciliated the minds of every one in this
country. Though she was in perfect
health, and appeared cheerful, yet, convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that her gaiety was assumed, and
the effect of a strong effort, I felt an impression
of melancholy, which it was not
in my power to overcome all the time we
remained at Zell.</p>

<p>From Zell we went to Hanover, and
on the evening of our arrival, had the
pleasure of hearing Handel’s Messiah performed.
Some of the best company of this
place were assembled on the occasion, and
we were here made acquainted with old
Field-Marshal Sporken, and other people
of distinction. Hanover is a neat, thriving
and agreeable city. It has more the
air of an English town than any other I
have seen in Germany, and the English
manners and customs gain ground every
day among the inhabitants. The genial
influence of freedom has extended from
England to this place. Tyranny is not
felt, and ease and satisfaction appear in the
countenances of the citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>This town is regularly fortified, and all
the works are in exceeding good order.
The troops are sober and regular, and perform
every essential part of duty well,
though the discipline is not so rigid as in
some other parts of Germany. Marshal
Sporken, who is the head of the army,
is a man of humanity; and though the
soldiers are severely punished for real
crimes, by the sentence of a court martial,
he does not permit his officers to order
them to be caned for trifles. Caprice is
too apt to blend itself with this method of
punishing, and men of cruel dispositions
are prone to indulge this diabolical propensity,
under the pretence of zeal for discipline.</p>

<p>The Hanoverian infantry are not so tall
as some of the other German troops, owing
to this, that nobody is forced into the
service, the soldiers are all volunteers;
whereas, in other parts of Germany, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Prince picks the stoutest and tallest of the
peasants, and obliges them to become soldiers.
It is allowed, that in action no
troops can behave better than the Hanoverians;
and it is certain, that desertion
is not so frequent among them as among
other German troops, which can only be
accounted for by their not being pressed
into the service, and their being more
gently used when in it.</p>

<p>It is not the mode here at present, to
lay so much stress on the tricks of the exercise
as formerly. The officers in general
seem to despise many minutiæ, which
are thought of the highest importance in
some other services. It is incredible to
what a ridiculous length this matter is
pushed by some.</p>

<p>At a certain parade, where the Sovereign
himself was present, and many officers
assembled, I once saw a corpulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
general-officer start suddenly, as if he had
seen something preternatural. He immediately
waddled towards the ranks with
all the expedition of a terrified gander. I
could not conceive what had put his Excellency
into a commotion so little suitable
to his years and habit of body. While
all the spectators were a-tiptoe to observe
the issue of this phenomenon, he arrived
at the ranks, and in great wrath, which
probably had been augmented by the heat
acquired in his course, he pulled off one
of the soldier’s hats, which it seems had
not been properly cocked, and adjusted
it to his mind. Having regulated the military
discipline in this important particular,
he returned to the Prince’s right-hand,
with a strut expressive of the highest
self-approbation.</p>

<p>Two days after our arrival here, I walked
to Hernhausen, along a magnificent avenue,
as broad, and about double the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
length of the mall at St. James’s. The
house itself has nothing extraordinary in
its appearance; but the gardens are as
fine as gardens planned in the Dutch taste,
and formed on ground perfectly level, can
be. The orangery is reckoned equal to
any in Europe. Here is a kind of rural
theatre, where plays may be acted during
the fine weather. There is a spacious
amphitheatre cut out in green seats for
the spectators; a stage in the same taste,
with rows of trees for side-scenes, and a
great number of arbours and summer-rooms,
surrounded by lofty hedges, for the
actors to retire and dress in.</p>

<p>When the theatre is illuminated, which
is always done when masquerades are
given, it must have a very fine effect.
The groves, arbours, and labyrinths, seem
admirably calculated for all the purpose
of this amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>In these gardens are several large reservoirs
and fountains, and on one side, a
canal above a quarter of a mile in length.
I have not seen the famous jet d’eau, as
the water-works have not been played off
since I came to Hanover. On the whole,
we pass our time very agreeably here. We
have dined twice with Baron de Lenth,
who has the chief direction of the affairs
of this electorate, and at his house have
met with the principal inhabitants. I make
one of Marshal Sporken’s party every night
at Whist, and pass most of my time in the
society at his house.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— having promised to
meet some company at Brunswick by a
certain day, we shall set out for that place
to-morrow—but have engaged to pay another
visit to Hanover before we go to
Berlin.—My next therefore will be from
Brunswick, or possibly from this place after
our return.</p>

<p>We remained a week at Brunswick,
and returned to this town about ten
days ago. None of the family are there
at present, except the Duke and Duchess,
and the young Princess, their daughter.</p>

<p>The character of the Sovereign, at every
court, has great influence in forming the
taste and manners of courtiers. This must
operate with increased force in the little
courts of Germany, where the parties are
brought nearer to each other, and spend
the most part of their time together. The
pleasure which the Duchess of Brunswick
takes in study, has made reading very
fashionable among the ladies of that Court:
of this her Royal Highness gave me a curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
instance the last time I had the honour of
seeing her.</p>

<p>A lady, whose education had been neglected
in her youth, and who had arrived
at a very ripe age without perceiving any
inconveniency from the accident, had obtained,
by the interest of some of her relations,
a place at the Court of Brunswick.
She had not been long there, till she perceived
that the conversation in the Duchess’s
apartments frequently turned on subjects of
which she was entirely ignorant, and that
those ladies had most of her Royal Highness’s
ear, who were best acquainted with
books. She regretted, for the first time,
the neglect of her own education; and although
she had hitherto considered that
kind of knowledge, which is derived from
reading, as unbecoming a woman of quality,
yet, as it was now fashionable at Court,
she resolved to study hard, that she might get
to the top of the mode as fast as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>She mentioned this resolution to the
Duchess, desiring, at the same time,
that her Highness would lend her a book
to begin. The Duchess applauded her
design, and promised to send her one of
the usefullest books in her library—it was a
French and German dictionary. Some
days after, her Highness enquired how she
relished the book. Infinitely, replied this
studious lady.—It is the most delightful
book I ever saw.—The sentences are all
short, and easily understood, and the letters
charmingly arranged in ranks, like
soldiers on the parade; whereas, in some
other books which I have seen, they are
mingled together in a confused manner,
like a mere mob, so that it is no pleasure
to look at them, and very difficult to know
what they mean. But I am no longer surprised,
added she, at the satisfaction your
Royal Highness takes in study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Since our return to Hanover, we have
dined twice at the Palace. There is a
household established with officers and servants,
and the guard is regularly mounted,
as at the time when the Electors resided
here constantly. The liveries of the pages
and servants are the same with those worn
by the King’s domestic servants at St.
James’s. Strangers of distinction are entertained
at the Palace in a very magnificent
manner. The first of the entertainments I
saw was given to the D—— of H——, and
the other to young Prince George of Hesse
Darmstadt, who arrived here a few days
since, with Prince Ernest and Prince
Charles of Mecklenburg, brothers to the
Queen of Great Britain, both of whom are
in the Hanoverian service.</p>

<p>Most of my time is spent as formerly,
at Marshal Sporken’s. The conversation of
a man of sense, who has been fifty years in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the service, and in high rank during a considerable
part of that time, which led him
into an intimacy with some of the most celebrated
characters of the age, you may be
sure is highly interesting. It affords me
satisfaction to be informed from such authority,
of many transactions in the last
war, the common accounts of which are
often different, and sometimes contradictory.
The Marshal’s observations are sensible
and candid, and his manner of converting
unreserved. He served with the
late Marshal Daun in the allied army, opposed
to Marshal Saxe, in the war 1741,
and has many curious anecdotes illustrating
the characters of some of the commanders
who conducted the armies during that memorable
period. He has a very high
opinion of Duke Ferdinand’s military character,
and declares, that of all the Generals
he ever served under, that Prince seemed
to him to have the best talents for conducting
an army. He says, that as Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Ferdinand had seldom held councils of war,
or communicated to the Generals of his
army, any more of his plans than they
were to execute, it was difficult for them
to form a just opinion of his capacity,
while they remained with the army immediately
under his command; but that he
(Marshal Sporken) had sometimes commanded
a detached army, which obliged
the Prince to be more communicative, and
afforded the Marshal the strongest proofs of
the depth of his judgment. Above all
things, he admired the perspicuity of his
written instructions.—— These, he said,
were always accompanied with the most
accurate and minute description of the
country through which he was to march,
every village, rivulet, hollow, wood, or
hill on the route, being distinctly particularised,
and the most judicious conjectures
concerning the enemy’s designs added, with
directions how to act in various probable
emergencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the whole, Marshal Sporken seemed
convinced that great part of the success
of the allies, during the late war in Westphalia,
was owing to the foresight, prudence,
and sagacity of their General. One
memorable event, however, which has
been cited as the most striking proof of all
these, he imagined was not so much owing
to any of them, as to the personal valour
of a few regiments, and the good conduct
of some inferior officers. The Marshal
added, that his praises of Duke Ferdinand’s
military abilities did not proceed from private
attachment, for he could claim no
share in his friendship; on the contrary, a
misunderstanding had happened between
them, on account of an incident at the
siege of Cassel, the particulars of which he
recapitulated, and this misunderstanding was
of a nature never to be made up.</p>

<p>The liberal, candid sentiments of this
venerable man carry conviction, and command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
esteem. He is respected by people
of all ranks, and listened to like an oracle.
In the society generally to be found at the
Marshal’s, there are some nearly of his
own age, who formed the private parties
of George the Second, as often as he came
to visit his native country. The memory
of that monarch is greatly venerated here.
I have heard his contemporaries of this society
relate a thousand little anecdotes concerning
him, which at once evinced the
good disposition of the King, and their
own gratitude. From these accounts it appeared,
that he was naturally of a very sociable
temper, and entirely laid aside, when
at Hanover, the state and reserve which he
retained in England, living in that familiar
and confidential manner which Princes, as
well as peasants, will assume in the company
of those they love, and who love them.</p>

<p>Not only the personal friends of that
monarch speak of him with regard, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
same sentiments prevail among all ranks of
people in the Electorate. Nothing does
more honour to his character, or can be a
less equivocal proof of his equity, than his
having governed these subjects, over whom
he had an unlimited power, with as much
justice and moderation as those whose
rights are guarded by law, and a jealous
constitution.</p>

<p>The two visits I have made to Hanover,
have confirmed the favourable impression
I had before received of the German character.
One of the most disagreeable circumstances
which attend travelling is, the
being obliged to leave acquaintances after
you have discovered their worth, and acquired
some degree of their friendship. As
the season for the Prussian reviews now
approaches, we have already taken leave
of our friends, and are to set out to-morrow
morning on our return to Brunswick,
that after remaining a few days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
there, we may still get to Potsdam in proper
time.</p>

<p>I shall not leave behind me every valuable
acquaintance I have acquired since I
came to Hanover.—We met, on our last
arrival here, with Mr. F——, son of Lord
F——. He has been of our parties ever
since, and will accompany us to Brunswick
and Potsdam.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXI">LETTER LXI.</h2>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>On returning to Brunswick, we found
the Hereditary Princess had come
from Zell a few days before, having left
the Queen of Denmark in perfect health.
The Princess resided with her children at
Antonettenruche, a villa a few miles from
Brunswick. She invited the D—— of
H——, Mr. F——, and me, to dine with
her the day before we were to set out for
Potsdam. That morning I chanced to
take a very early walk in the gardens of
the palace.—The Duke of Brunswick was
there.—He informed me, that an express
had arrived with news of the Queen of
Denmark’s death.—They had received accounts
a few days before that she had been
seized with a putrid fever.—He said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
nobody in the town or court knew of this,
except his own family, and desired that I
would not mention it to the Princess,
who, he knew, would be greatly affected;
for he intended to send a person, after her
company should be gone, who would inform
her of this event, with all its circumstances.</p>

<p>When we went, we found the Princess
in some anxiety about her sister;—yet
rather elated with the accounts she had received
that day by the post. She showed
us her letters.—They contained a general
description of the symptoms, and conveyed
some hopes of the Queen’s recovery.
Unable to bear the idea of her sister’s death,
she wrested every expression into the most
favourable sense, and the company met her
wishes, by confirming the interpretation
she gave. To me, who knew the truth,
this scene was affecting and painful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>As we returned to Brunswick in the
evening, we met the gentleman who was
commissioned by the Duke to impart the
news of the Queen’s death to her sister.—We
supped the same night at court, and
took leave of this illustrious family.—The
Duchess gave me a letter to her son, Prince
Frederick, at Berlin, which she said would
secure me a good reception at that capital.</p>

<p>On coming to the inn, we found a very
numerous company, and the whole house
resounded with music and dancing. It is
customary all over Germany, after a marriage
of citizens, to give the wedding-feast
at an inn. As there was no great chance
of our being much refreshed by sleep that
night, instead of going to bed, we ordered
post-horses, and left Brunswick about three
in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>We arrived the same afternoon at Magdeburg.
The country all the way is perfectly
level. The Duchy of Magdeburg
produces fine cattle, and a considerable
quantity of corn, those parts which are not
marshy, and over-grown with wood, being
very fertile. I have seen few or no inclosures
in this, or any part of Germany,
except such as surround the gardens or
parks of Princes.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia has a seat in the
diet of the empire, as Duke of Magdeburg.
The capital, which bears the same
name with the duchy, is a very considerable
town, well built and strongly fortified.
There are manufactories here of
cotton and linen goods, of stockings, gloves,
and tobacco; but the principal are those of
woollen and silk.</p>

<p>The German woollen cloths are, in general,
much inferior to the English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
French. The Prussian officers, however,
assert, that the dark blue cloth made here,
and in other parts of the King of Prussia’s
dominions, though coarser, wears better,
and has a more decent appearance when
long worn, than the finest cloth manufactured
in England or France.—Thus much
is certain, that the Prussian blue is preferable
to any other cloth made in Germany.—The
town of Magdeburg is happily
situated for trade, having an easy communication
with Hamburg by the Elbe,
and lying on the road between Upper and
Lower Germany. It is also the strongest
place belonging to his Prussian Majesty,
and where his principal magazines and
foundries are established. In time of war,
it is the repository of whatever he finds necessary
to place out of the reach of sudden
insult.</p>

<p>Places where any extraordinary event
has happened, even though they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
have nothing else to distinguish them, interest
me more than the most flourishing
country, or finest town which has never
been the scene of any thing memorable.
Fancy, awakened by the view of the
former, instantly gives shape and features
to men we have never seen.—We hear
them speak, and see them act; the passions
are excited, the mind amused; the houses,
the rivers, the fields around supplying the
absence of the poet and historian, and restoring
with new energy the whole scene
to the mind.</p>

<p>While crossing the Elbe at this town
with the D—— of H——, I recalled to
his memory the dreadful tragedy which
was acted here by the Austrian General
Tilly, who having taken this town by
storm, delivered up the citizens, without
distinction of age or sex, to the barbarity
and lust of his soldiers. Besides the general
massacre, they exhibited such acts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
wanton cruelty, as disgrace human nature.
We viewed with a lively sympathy, that
part of the river where three or four hundred
of the inhabitants got over and made
their escape:—all that were saved out of
twenty thousand citizens!</p>

<p>This sad catastrophe supplied us with
conversation for great part of this day’s
journey. It is unnecessary to comment on
an event of this kind to a person of the
D——’s sensibility.—Proper reflections arise
spontaneously in a well-formed mind from
the simple narrative.</p>

<p>The country is well cultivated, and fertile
for about two leagues beyond Magdeburg;
afterwards it becomes more barren,
and within a few leagues of Brandenburg,
it is as naked and sandy as the deserts of
Arabia.</p>

<p>Brandenburg, from which the whole
Electorate takes its name, is but a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
town, divided into Old and New by a
river, which separates the fort from both.
The principal trade is carried on by some
French woollen manufacturers, whom the
King has encouraged to reside at this town.
The whole number of inhabitants does not
amount to more than 1500.</p>

<p>On entering the Prussian garrison towns,
you are stopped at the gate; the officer of
the guard asks your name, whence you
come, whither you are going, and takes
your answers down in writing. This is
done in the French garrisons also, but
not with the same degree of form and accuracy.</p>

<p>When the title of Duke is given, the
guard generally turns out under arms. As
for Milord, it is a title treated with very
little ceremony, either in France or Germany.
It is often assumed in foreign
countries by those who have no right to it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and given to every Englishman of a decent
appearance. But Duke, in Germany, implies
a Sovereign, and is more respectable
than Prince. Every son of a Duke in this
country, is called Prince, although he had
as many as old King Priam.</p>

<p>We arrived last night at Potsdam, which
important piece of news, you will please to
observe, I have taken the earliest opportunity
of communicating.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXII">LETTER LXII.</h2>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival here, I waited
on the Count Finkenstein, and desired
to know when the D—— of H—— and
I could have the honour of being presented
to the King, requesting, at the same time,
the liberty of attending at the reviews.
I was not a little surprised when this minister
told me, that I must write a letter
to his Majesty, informing him of that request,
and that I should certainly receive
an answer the day following. It appeared
very singular to write to so great a Prince
upon an affair of such small importance;
but the Count told me this was the established
rule. So I immediately did as I
was desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning one of the court-servants
called for me at the inn, and delivered a
sealed letter addressed to me, and signed
by the King, importing, that as the
court would soon be at Berlin, the minister
in waiting there would let the
D—— of H—— and Mr. —— know when
they might be presented, and that they
were very welcome to attend at all the
reviews.</p>

<p>In the evening we were presented to the
Prince and Princess of Prussia, who reside
almost constantly at Potsdam. He is a tall,
stout-made, handsome man, of about
thirty-five years of age. The Princess is
of the family of Hesse-Darmstadt, and has
a great resemblance to her aunt, whom
we had seen at Carlsruhe. We have had
the honour of supping with them twice
during the few days we have been at
Potsdam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince and all the officers have been
employed every morning in preparing for
the reviews. Yesterday, for the second
time, there were seven thousand men reviewed
by the King. The Prince of Prussia’s
son, a child of six or seven years old,
was present on foot with his tutor, and
unattended by any officer or servant. They
mingled without any mark of distinction
among the other spectators. I mentioned
my surprise at this to the tutor. In France,
said he, it would be otherwise: the Dauphin,
at the age of this child, would be
carried to the review in a coach, with a
troop of musqueteers to attend him; but
here, the King and Prince are equally desirous
that their successor should be brought
up in a hardy manner, and without any
strong impression of his own importance.
Sentiments of that kind will come soon
enough, in spite of all the pains that can
be taken to exclude them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The troops were drawn up in one line
along the summits of some hills. From
this situation they descended over very
unequal and rough ground, firing in grand
divisions all the way, till they came to the
plain, where they went through various
evolutions. But as we were to set out in a
little time for Berlin, where the grand reviews
of that garrison are to take place, I
shall say no more on the subject of reviews
till then.</p>

<p>Our mornings, since we came hither,
have always been passed with the troops
in the field. The forenoons we have spent
in looking at every thing curious in the
town. The houses are built of a fine
white free-stone, almost all of them new,
and nearly of the same height. The
streets are regular and well paved, and
there are some very magnificent public
buildings; so that Potsdam has every requisite
to form an agreeable town, if by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that word is meant the streets, stone-walls,
and external appearance. But if a more
complex idea be annexed to the word, and
if it be thought to comprehend the finishing,
furniture, and conveniencies within the
houses, in that case Potsdam is a very poor
town indeed.</p>

<p>The King having expressed a great inclination
to see this town increase, several
monied people built houses, partly to pay
their court to his Majesty, and partly because,
by letting them, they found they
would receive very good interest for their
money. But as the town did not augment
so quickly as he wished, his Majesty
ordered several streets to be built at once,
at his own expence. This immediately
sunk the value of houses, and the first
builders found they had disposed of their
money very injudiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Towns generally are formed by degrees,
as the inhabitants increase in numbers; and
houses are built larger and more commodious
as they increase in riches; for men’s
ideas of conveniency enlarge with their
wealth. But here the matter is reversed:
the houses are reared in the first place, in
hopes that their fair outsides, like the
nymphs of Circe, will allure travellers, and
attract inhabitants. Hitherto their power
of attraction has not been strong; for few
towns are worse inhabited than Potsdam,
though the houses are let to merchants and
trades-people at very small rents.</p>

<p>I was not a little surprised, while I walked
through the town, to see buff-belts,
breeches and waistcoats, hanging to dry
from the genteelest looking houses, till I
was informed, that each housekeeper has
two or more soldiers quartered in his
house, and their apartments are, for the
most part, on the first floor, with windows
to the street; which I am told is also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
case at Berlin. The King chooses that
his soldiers should be quartered with the
citizens, rather than in barracks. This
ought to be a sufficient answer to those
military gentlemen, who insist on building
barracks for the soldiers in Britain, upon
the supposition, that our army cannot be
well disciplined without them. For it
could scarcely be expected, or wished, that
the British army were under more rigid discipline
than the Prussian.</p>

<p>I imagine the Prussian soldiers are quartered
in private houses rather than barracks,
from considerations diametrically opposite
to those which produce the same effect in
England.—The British parliament have always
shown an aversion to lodging the military
in barracks, and have preferred quartering
them in the citizens’ houses, that a
connection and good-will may be cultivated
between the soldiers and their fellow-citizens;
and that the former may not consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
themselves as a distinct body of men,
with a separate interest from the rest of the
community, and whose duty it is implicitly
to obey the will of the crown at all times,
and upon all occasions.</p>

<p>Whereas here it may not be thought
expedient, to lodge great bodies of armed
men together in barracks, lest they should,
during the night, form combinations destructive
of discipline, and dangerous to
government. This cannot happen in the
day-time, because then the officers are present,
and the soldiers are not allowed even
to speak to each other when under arms;
and while off duty, their time is wholly
filled up in cleaning their arms, accoutrements,
and clothes, and preparing for the
next guard.—I imagine these may be part,
at least, of the reasons which induce the
King of Prussia to prefer quartering his
men in private houses; for in all other respects,
lodging them together in barracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
would be more convenient, and more agreeable
to the genius of his government.</p>

<p>The palace at Potsdam, or what they
call the castle, is a very noble building,
with magnificent gardens adjacent. I shall
not trouble you with a description of either,
only it struck me as a thing rather uncommon
in a palace, to find the study by far
the finest apartment in it. The ornaments
of this are of massy silver. The writing-desk,
the embellishments of the table, and
the accommodations for the books, were all
in fine taste.</p>

<p>The person who attended us, asked if
we had any desire to see his Majesty’s
wardrobe?—On being answered in the affirmative,
he conducted us to the chamber
where the monarch’s clothes are deposited;
it had a very different appearance from his
library. The whole wardrobe consisted
of two blue coats, faced with red, the lining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of one a little torn;—two yellow waistcoats,
a good deal soiled with Spanish
snuff;—three pair of yellow breeches, and
a suit of blue velvet, embroidered with
silver, for grand occasions.</p>

<p>I imagined at first, that the man had
got a few of the King’s old clothes, and
kept them here to amuse strangers; but,
upon enquiry, I was assured, that what I
have mentioned, with two suits of uniform
which he has at Sans-Souci, form the
entire wardrobe of the King of Prussia.
Our attendant said, he had never known it
more complete. As for the velvet suit, it
was about ten years of age, and still enjoyed
all the vigour of youth. Indeed, if the
moths spared it as much as his Majesty has
done, it may last the age of Methusalem.—In
the same room, are some standards belonging
to the cavalry. Instead of the
usual square flag, two or three of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
have the figures of eagles in carved silver
fixed on a pole.</p>

<p>In the bed-chamber where the late King
died, at the lower part of the window
which looks into the garden, four panes
have been removed, and a piece of glass
equal in size to all the four supplies their
place. We were informed that his late
Majesty’s supreme delight through life had
been to see his troops exercise, and that he
had retained this passion till his last breath.
When he was confined to his room by his
last illness, he used to sit and view them
through the window, which had been
framed in this manner, that he might enjoy
these dying contemplations with the
greater conveniency. Becoming gradually
weaker by the increasing distemper, he
could not sit, but was obliged to lie on a
couch through the day. When at any
time he was uncommonly languid, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
raised his head to the window, and a sight
of the men under arms was perceived to
operate like a cordial, and revive his spirits.—By
frequent repetition, however,
even this cordial lost its effect.—His eyes
became dim—when his head was raised, he
could no longer perceive the soldiers, and
he expired.</p>

<p>This was feeling the ruling passion as
strong in death as any man ever felt it.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXIII">LETTER LXIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>I have been twice or thrice at Sans-Souci,
which is at a small distance from
Potsdam. The King lives constantly at
the Old Palace, except when some people
of very great distinction come to reside with
him for some days. He then receives them
at the New Palace, and remains there himself
during their stay.</p>

<p>The gallery contains a great collection
of paintings, some of them originals, highly
esteemed.—The most valuable are of the
Flemish school.—Some people who pass
for connoisseurs, and for aught I know
may be what they pretend, assert, that the
King has not a just taste in painting, which
appears by his purchasing a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
very indifferent pictures. Whatever may
be in that, it is certain that his Majesty
does not give the least importance to the
opinion of these connoisseurs; but buys,
admires, and avows his admiration of such
pieces as appear excellent in his own eyes,
without regarding what they or others
may think. It has no weight with him,
that the piece is said to be by Raphaël,
Guido, or Corregio. If he see no beauty
in it, he says so, and without ceremony
prefers the work of a modern or obscure
painter.</p>

<p>This is considered by many critics in
painting as blasphemy, and shocks them
more than any other species of impiety. A
painter and great connoisseur whom the
King had disgusted, by rejecting some
pictures of his recommending, and by purchasing
others which he had condemned,
said (speaking of the King), The man
imagines, because he can play on the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
flute, and has been praised by a parcel
of poets and philosophers, and has
gained ten or a dozen battles, that therefore
he understands painting; but fighting
battles is one thing, and a true knowledge
of painting is another, and that he will
find to his cost.</p>

<p>A few years after the late war, the King
of Prussia began to build the new palace
of Sans-Souci, which is now completely
finished, and is certainly a very noble
and splendid work. The offices are at a
considerable distance, and are joined to the
body of the palace by a double colonnade,
which has a very grand effect. The front
of the palace seems rather crowded, by the
great number of statues which are intended
to ornament it. These are generally in
groups, representing some story from Ovid.
This building has a cupola, terminated by
a large crown, supported by the three
Graces. The D—— of H—— observed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that three Prussian grenadiers would have
been more suitable. On the ground-floor,
in the middle, there is a large hall, whose
floor, sides, and roof, are all of marble.
It is called the grotto, and the ornaments
correspond with that name. This room
can be agreeable only when the weather is
excessively hot. In Italy it would be delightful.
The roof of this hall is low, and
vaulted, and supports another room in all
respects of the same dimensions, only
higher. This second room is also lined
with beautiful marble. The other apartments
are adorned with rich furniture and
paintings, all very showy. Many people
think them gaudy.—It must be owned,
that the gilding is laid on with a very
lavish hand.</p>

<p>Opposite to the old palace of Sans-Souci,
and immediately without the gardens,
Lord Marechal has built a house, where
he constantly resides. You are well acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with the amiable character of this
nobleman. We waited on him soon after
our arrival, and have dined with him several
times since. On the front of his
house is this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">FREDERICUS II. NOBIS HÆC OTIA FECIT.</p>

<p>Adjoining to this house is a small garden,
with a door which communicates with the
King’s garden of Sans-Souci, so that his
Lordship has the full enjoyment of these
gardens. The King has also a key to my
Lord’s little garden, and frequently walks
by this passage to visit him.</p>

<p>We set out for Berlin to-morrow. Adieu.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXIV">LETTER LXIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>We arrived here in the height of the
preparation for the reviews. Nothing
was to be seen in the streets but soldiers
parading, and officers hurrying backwards
and forwards. The town looked
more like the cantonment of a great army,
than the capital of a kingdom in the time
of profound peace. The Court itself resembled
the levee of a General in the field—except
the foreign ministers, and a few
strangers, every man there (for there were
no women) was dressed in a military uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris, the British minister, attended
the D—— of H——, the day we were
presented to the King. A son of Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Kaunitz’s, and some other strangers, were
presented at the same time. The Count
Reuse, chamberlain of the Court, named
each person to his Majesty as he approached.
He conversed a considerable time with
the D——, and spoke a few words to
every person who was presented.—His
countenance and manner are exceedingly
animated.—He seemed that day in very
high spirits, and spoke to all his officers in
an easy style, and with a kind of gay affability.
On their part, they appear before
their master with an erect military boldness,
free from that cringing address which
prevails in many Courts, but would not
succeed here.</p>

<p>The King was three days at Berlin before
the reviews began, and passed some
hours every morning in the park, where
there were four or five thousand men ordered
daily, not to be exercised, but simply
that the King might examine the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of each corps in particular: and it is incredible
with what accuracy and minute attention
he did examine them, the Colonel
of the regiment under scrutiny walking
along with him, to answer any question,
and hear his directions and remarks. By
this exactness, he not only knows the condition
of the army in general, but the appearance,
degree of discipline, and strength
of each regiment.</p>

<p>The whole number reviewed was about
thirty-six or thirty-eight thousand, consisting
of the garrison of Berlin, and troops
from some of the adjacent towns and villages.
This army was in the field three
mornings successively, and the operations
were different each day. I shall endeavour
to give you an idea of the plan of the last
day’s review, which is freshest in my memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>At break of day, about eight thousand
men marched out of Berlin, under the
command of a general officer, and took
possession of a village, situated on a rising
ground, at the distance of two or three
miles. About an hour after, the King
himself joined the army, which was assembled
without the gates. He divided
it into three columns. Two general officers
took the command of two of them; he
himself led the third. The whole marched
by three different routes towards the village,
where the former detachment had
now taken post. In the attack and defence
of this village the review consisted.</p>

<p>As the army advanced, they were cannonaded
from the village, but could not
be supposed to suffer much, because the
leader of each column advanced with caution,
taking such circuits as exposed the
men very little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the three columns met on a
large plain near the village, but protected
from the batteries by a rising of the
ground. Here the King formed the army
into two lines. While this was doing,
they were perfectly secure; but they could
not advance towards the village otherwise
than by going over the swell in the ground,
and being exposed to all the cannon of the
enemy. This was to be performed, therefore,
with as much expedition as could be
consistent with good order. The right
wing of the army made the attack. As
soon as the signal was given, all the drums
and fifes struck up at once. The soldiers
advanced with a rapid pace. A numerous
train of large field-pieces, placed at proper
intervals, advanced with equal velocity,
and kept in a line with the front rank.
The rapidity with which they were charged
and discharged as they advanced was quite
astonishing. When the line came within
a proper distance of the village, the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
began to use their firelocks. In the
mean time there was a furious cannonade,
and discharge of small shot from the village.
The King was between the advancing
line and the village during the attack.
When they had got very near the hedges,
a new battery opened from the village.
The King gave a signal, and the first line
broke, fell into an artificial confusion, and
gave back towards the second line, which
opened at several places, and closed again
the moment the retreating line had pierced
through. The second line then moved to
the attack, as the former had done. This
also seemed to be repulsed—a retreat was
sounded, and the whole wing began to
retire. A body of cavalry then appeared
from the village, and were advancing to
charge the retreating army, but were themselves
charged, and driven back, by the
cavalry of the right wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>A body of hussars pursued also from the
village, and harassed the retreating army.
These were sometimes repulsed by the soldiers,
who turned and fired on them, and
sometimes by detached parties of cavalry,
which drove them away.</p>

<p>These various operations lasted from
five in the morning till noon, when the
troops returned to Berlin.—It is hardly
possible for any words of mine to convey
an adequate idea of the perfect manner
in which these evolutions were executed.
The charges made by the cavalry were
praised by the King himself. I had never
seen so great a body together, and had no
idea that it was possible to charge at full
gallop, and keep the ranks and distances
so exactly as they did.</p>

<p>Upon the principle, that velocity is equal
to weight, they endeavour to compensate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for the lightness of the horses by the
quickness of their motion. The hussars
in the Prussian army are taught, not only
to harass a retreating army in detached
parties, but to charge like heavy cavalry
in a large body. The late General Seidlitz,
who had the reputation of being the
best officer of cavalry in Europe, brought
the Prussian dragoons to a wonderful degree
of perfection, and it is said that he
gained the battle of Rosbach by one brisk
charge. Ever since, the King of Prussia
has bestowed great attention on his cavalry.
They are now habituated to charge in
large bodies, and at full speed.</p>

<p>The cuirassiers are the flower of the
Prussian army. They are dressed in buff
coats, and wear very heavy iron breastplates,
which cover all the fore-part of
the body, and have been tried by musket-shot
before they are delivered to the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>I neglected to mention, that the infantry
were ordered to shout as they advanced to the
attack on the village, and that this practice is
adopted by the Prussians in actual service.
The King, as I am informed, is of opinion,
that this keeps up the spirits of the
men, and prevents them from reflecting
on the danger of their situation. There
are a greater proportion of drummers in
the Prussian service than in most others:
a regulation, in all probability, founded on
the same principle.</p>

<p>The evening after the reviews, there
were a concert and supper at Prince Henry’s
palace. The Queen was present, and
the King’s brothers, Henry himself, and
Ferdinand, with their Princesses; also the
Prince and Princess of Prussia, Prince
Frederick of Brunswick and his Princess,
and a numerous company. I here delivered
to Prince Frederick the letter I had
brought from his mother, who I found had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
before apprized him of my intention to go
to Berlin.</p>

<p>The King himself was not present. He
seldom appears at festivals. All his hours,
not employed in business, he spends in
reading, or in the society of a few people
whom he esteems. The Hereditary Prince
of Brunswick is at present the King’s most
constant companion, a choice which does
not more honour to the Prince than to the
King’s discernment.</p>

<p>Prince Henry’s palace is one of the most
magnificent buildings in Berlin. No subject
of the King of Prussia lives in a more
sumptuous manner than this Prince, who
keeps a numerous establishment of servants,
mostly handsome young men, very richly
dressed. The entertainment on this occasion
was remarkably splendid.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXV">LETTER LXV.</h2>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>The day after the reviews, the King,
attended by his nephew, the Prince of
Prussia, and the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick,
set out for Magdeburg, where there
is a camp of 15,000 men. He afterwards
will proceed to Silesia, and his new acquired
dominions in Poland, and is not expected
at Potsdam for six weeks at least.</p>

<p>His Majesty makes the same circuit
twice every year.—Surely no King in Europe
can have such a thorough knowledge
of his dominions and subjects as this monarch.—His
absence from Berlin has made
but little relaxation in the duty, and none
in the discipline of the troops. The reviews
were scarcely over, when field-days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
began. There are 1500 or 2000 of the
troops belonging to this garrison, exercised
in the park almost every morning, besides
those who appear on the parade for the ordinary
guards.</p>

<p>A review, such as that which I endeavoured
to describe, is undoubtedly one of
the finest shows that can be exhibited: but
when a spectator of sensibility reflects on
the means by which these poor fellows are
brought to this wonderful degree of accuracy,
he will pay a severe tax for this splendid
exhibition.—The Prussian discipline on
a general view is beautiful; in detail it is
shocking.</p>

<p>When the young rustic is brought to
the regiment, he is at first treated with a
degree of gentleness; he is instructed by
words only how to walk, and to hold up
his head, and to carry his firelock, and he
is not punished, though he should not succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in his earliest attempts:—they allow
his natural aukwardness and timidity to
wear off by degrees:—they seem cautious
of confounding him at the beginning, or
driving him to despair, and take care not to
pour all the terrors of their discipline upon
his astonished senses at once. When he
has been a little familiarised to his new
state, he is taught the exercise of the firelock,
first alone, and afterwards with two
or three of his companions. This is not
entrusted to a corporal or serjeant; it is the
duty of a subaltern officer. In the park at
Berlin, every morning may be seen the
Lieutenants of the different regiments exercising
with the greatest assiduity, sometimes
a single man, at other times three or
four together; and now, if the young recruit
shows neglect or remissness, his attention
is roused by the officer’s cane, which
is applied with augmenting energy, till he
has acquired the full command of his firelock.—He
is taught steadiness under arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and the immobility of a statue;—he is informed,
that all his members are to move
only at the word of command, and not at
his own pleasure;—that speaking, coughing,
sneezing, are all unpardonable crimes;
and when the poor lad is accomplished to
their mind, they give him to understand,
that now it is perfectly known what he
can do, and therefore the smallest deficiency
will be punished with rigour. And although
he should destine every moment of
his time, and all his attention, to cleaning
his arms, taking care of his clothes, and
practising the manual exercise, it is but
barely possible for him to escape punishment;
and if his captain happens to be of
a capricious or cruel disposition, the ill-fated
soldier loses the poor chance of that
possibility.</p>

<p>As for the officers, they are not indeed
subjected to corporal punishment, but
they are obliged to bestow as unremitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
attention on duty as the men. The
subalterns are almost constantly on guard,
or exercising the recruits: the Captain
knows, that he will be blamed by his Colonel,
and can expect no promotion, if his
company be not as perfect as the others:
the Colonel entirely loses the King’s favour
if his regiment should fail in any particular:
the General is answerable for the discipline
of the brigade, or garrison, under his immediate
command. The King will not be
satisfied with the General’s report on that
subject, but must examine every thing himself;
so that from his Majesty, down to the
common centinel, every individual is alert.
And as the King, who is the chief spring
and primum mobile of the whole, never
relaxes, the faculties of every subordinate
person are kept in constant exertion: the
consequence of which is, that the Prussian
army is the best disciplined, and the readiest
for service at a minute’s warning, of any
now in the world, or perhaps that ever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in it. Other monarchs have attempted to
carry discipline to the same degree of perfection,
and have begun this plan with
astonishing eagerness. But a little time
and new objects have blunted their keenness,
and divided their attention. They
have then delegated the execution to a
commander in chief, he to another of inferior
rank, and thus a certain degree of
relaxation having once taken place, soon
pervades the whole system; but the perseverance
of the King of Prussia is without
example, and is perhaps the most remarkable
part of his extraordinary character.</p>

<p>That degree of exertion which a man
of a vigorous mind is capable of making
on some very important occasion, the King
of Prussia has made for thirty years at a
stretch, without permitting pleasure, indolence,
disgust, or disappointment, to interrupt
his plan for a single day.—And he
has obliged every person through the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
departments of his government to
make, as far as their characters and
strength could go, the same exertions.—I
leave you to judge in what manner such a
man must be served, and what he is capable
of performing.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXVI">LETTER LXVI.</h2>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>No condition in life can be more active,
and at the same time have less variety
in it, than that of a Prussian officer
in the time of peace. He is continually
employed in the same occupation, and continually
occupied in the same place. There
is no rotation of the troops as in the British
service. The regiments which were placed
in Berlin, Magdeburg, Schweidnitz, and
the other garrisons at the conclusion of the
war, remain there still. It is dreaded, that
if they were occasionally moved from one
garrison to another, the foreigners in the
service, who are exceedingly prone to desertion,
might then find opportunities,
which according to the present plan they
cannot: for however desirous a Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
soldier may be to desert, the thing is almost
impossible. The moment a man is
missing, a certain number of cannons are
fired, which announce the desertion to the
whole country. The peasants have a considerable
reward for seizing a deserter, and
are liable to severe penalties if they harbour,
or aid him in making his escape,
and parties from the garrisons are sent after
him in every direction.</p>

<p>As none of the soldiers are ever allowed
to go without the walls of the town, it requires
great address to get over this first
difficulty; and when they have been so far
fortunate, many chances remain against
their escaping through the Prussian dominions;
and even when they arrive safe in
any of the neighbouring states,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Nunc eadem fortuna viros tot casibus actos</div>
<div class="verse">Insequitur.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">For there they will probably be obliged to
inlist again as soldiers; so that on the
whole, however unhappy they may be, it
is absurd to attempt desertion in any other
way than by killing themselves, which method,
as I am told, begins to prevail.</p>

<p>In consequence of their remaining constantly
in the same place, conversing always
with the same people, and being employed
uniformly in the same business, the
Prussian officers acquire a staid, serious appearance,
exceedingly different from the
gay, dissipated, degagé air of British or
French officers. Their only amusement,
or relaxation from the duties of their profession,
seems to be walking on the parade,
and conversing with each other. The inferior
officers, thus deprived of opportunities
of mixing in general society, and not
having time for study, can have no very
extensive range of ideas. Their knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it must be confessed, is pretty much confined
to that branch of tactics in which
they are so much employed; and many
of them at length seem to think, that to
stand firm and steady, to march erect, to
wheel to the right and left, and to charge
and discharge a firelock, if not the sole
use of human creatures, is at least the chief
end of their creation.</p>

<p>The King, as I have been informed,
has no inclination that they should reason
on a larger compass of thought, which
might possibly lead them to despise their
daily employment of drilling soldiers,
counting the buttons of their coats, and
examining the state of their spatter-dashes
and breeches. For as soon as men’s
minds become superior to their business,
the business will not be so well performed.
Some application to other studies, and opportunities
of mixing with a more general
society, might make them more agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
men, but not better captains, lieutenants,
and adjutants.</p>

<p>His Majesty imagines he will always find a
sufficient number of men of a more liberal
turn of mind, and more extensive notions,
for officers of great trust and separate commands,
where the general must act according
to emergencies, and the light of his own
understanding. He believes also, that this
general system will not deprive him of
the advantage of particular exceptions, or
prevent genius from being distinguished,
when it exists in the humblest spheres of
his service. As often, therefore, as he
observes any dawnings of this kind; when
any officer, or even soldier, discovers uncommon
talents, or an extensive capacity,
he is sure to be advanced, and placed in a
situation where his abilities may have a
full power of exertion; while those must
stand still, or be moved by a very slow gradation,
who have no other merit to depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
on for promotion but assiduity alone,
which, in the Prussian service, can never
conduct to that rank in the army, where
other qualifications are wanted.</p>

<p>As to the common men, the leading
idea of the Prussian discipline is to reduce
them, in many respects, to the nature of
machines; that they may have no volition
of their own, but be actuated solely by
that of their officers; that they may have
such a superlative dread of those officers as
annihilates all fear of the enemy; and that
they may move forwards when ordered,
without deeper reasoning or more concern
than the firelocks they carry along with
them.</p>

<p>Considering the length to which this
system is carried, it were to be wished
that it could be carried still further, and
that those unhappy men, while they retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the faculties of hearing and obeying
orders, could be deprived of every
other kind of feeling.</p>

<p>The common state of slavery in Asia,
or that to which people of civil professions
in the most despotic countries are
subject, is freedom in comparison of this
kind of military slavery. The former are
not continually under the eyes of their
tyrants, but for long intervals of time may
enjoy life without restraint, and as their
taste dictates; but all the foreign soldiers
in this service, and those of the natives,
who are suspected of any intention to desert,
and consequently never allowed furloughs,
are always under the eye of somebody,
who has the power, and too often
the inclination, to controul every action
of their bodies, and every desire of their
hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Since such a number of men all over
Europe are doomed to this state of constraint,
it is much to be lamented that,
from the nature of the service, the doom
should fall on the useful, industrious peasantry,
who, when uncontrolled by cruel
and absurd policy, pass their days in cheerfulness,
tasting every real pleasure without
the nausea of satiety, or the stings of remorse,
and perhaps, of all mankind, have
the greatest enjoyment of life. The sum-total
of happiness, destroyed by removing
men from this situation into a state of misery,
must be infinitely greater than if
many of the useless, wealthy, and luxurious
could be translated into the same
state. This would not be annihilating
happiness, but only shifting the scene of
the wretched. Such recruits would only
be harassed by the caprices of others instead
of their own;—plagued with the
manual exercise, instead of being tortured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
by peevishness and disgust;—laid up in
consequence of running the gantlet, instead
of being laid up with the gout;—and,
finally, knocked down by a cannon-ball,
instead of being killed by a fit of the
apoplexy or a surfeit.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXVII">LETTER LXVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>Instead of troubling you with any
more observations of my own, on the
nature of the Prussian discipline, or the
principles on which it is founded, I shall
give you the substance of some conversations
I have had on that subject with a
Prussian officer of character.</p>

<p>Walking one morning in the park, we
saw a poor fellow smartly caned, for no
other reason, but because he did not return
the ram-rod into his piece with so
much celerity as the rest of the platoon.
I turned away with indignation from the
sight, which the officer observing, said,
You think the punishment too severe for
the crime?—There was no crime, said I:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the ram-rod slipt through his fingers by
accident, and it is not possible to imagine,
that the man had any intention to perform
this important motion less rapidly
than his comrades. Every thing must be
considered as of importance by a soldier,
replied my Prussian acquaintance, which
his officer orders him to do. In all probability,
the fault was involuntary; but
it is not always possible to distinguish involuntary
faults from those that happen
through negligence. To prevent any man
from hoping that his negligence will be
forgiven as involuntary, all blunders are
punished, from whatever cause they happen;
the consequence of which is, that
every man is more attentive and alert than
he would otherwise be. I remember, added
he, that it was very usual on field-days for
the dragoons to have their hats blown off.
Nobody suspected that they had bribed
the wind to play this trick; yet a general
officer being put out of humour by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
frequency of the accident, gave orders to
punish every man to whom it should happen;
and since that order was put in force,
the hats have been much seldomer blown
off.</p>

<p>I then mentioned a fact which appeared
to me still more extraordinary. A hussar,
at the last review, had fallen from his
horse at full gallop, and was so much
bruised, that it was found necessary to
carry him to the hospital; and I had been
assured, that as soon as the man should
be perfectly recovered, he would certainly
be punished for having fallen. Now, continued
I, though a man may be a little
careless about his hat, it cannot be imagined,
that this hussar was not seriously
inclined to keep his seat; for by falling,
he might have broke his neck, or have
been trod to death: Or, even if you
choose to suppose, that he did not ride
with all the attention he ought, yet, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
he received one severe punishment by the
fall, it would be cruel to inflict another.
I have nothing to oppose to the solidity
of your argument, replied the Prussian,
but that General Seidlitz, who was the
best officer of cavalry in the world, first
introduced this piece of cruelty, since
which it is certain, that the men have
not fallen so often. The King imagines,
continued the Prussian, that discipline is
the soul of an army; that men in the different
nations of Europe are, in those
qualities which are thought necessary for
a soldier, nearly on a par; that in two
armies of equal numbers, the degrees of
discipline will determine how far one is
superior to the other. His great object,
therefore, is to keep his own army at the
highest possible degree of perfection in this
essential point. If that could be done by
gentle means, undoubtedly he would prefer
them.—He is not naturally of a cruel
disposition.—His general conduct to officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of rank proves this.—Finding that the
hopes of promotion, and a sense of honour,
are sufficient motives to prompt
them to their duty, he never has had recourse,
except in cases of treachery, to
any higher punishment than dismissing
them. In some remarkable instances, he
has displayed more mildness than is usual
in any other service. Some of his Generals
have allowed towns of the greatest importance
to be taken by surprise; others
have lost intire armies; yet he never was
influenced by popular clamour, or by the
ruinous condition of his own affairs in
consequence of those losses, to put any of
the unfortunate generals to death. And
when any of them have been suspended
for a certain time, or declared, by the
decree of a court-martial, incapable of a
military command under him, he has never
aggravated the sentence by any opprobrious
commentary, but has rather alleviated
it by some clause or message,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
which spared the honour of the condemned
general.</p>

<p>The common soldiers cannot be kept to
their duty by mild treatment. Severe and
immediate corporal punishment is found
absolutely necessary.—Not to use it at
all, or to use it in a degree incapable
of producing the full effect, would be
weakness. Soldiers are sometimes punished
for slips, which perhaps all their attention
cannot prevent; because, though
it is impossible to ascertain, that any particular
man could have avoided them, yet
experience has taught, that, by punishing
every blunder, fewer are committed on
the whole. This sufficiently justifies the
practice of what you call cruelty, but
which is in reality salutary discipline; for
an individual suffering unjustly is not so
great an evil in an army, as the permitting
negligence to pass unpunished. To
allow ten guilty men to escape, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
than risk the punishment of one innocent
person, may be a good maxim in morality,
or in civil government, but the reverse will
be found preferable in military discipline.</p>

<p>When the Prussian had finished his discourse,
I said, You seem to neglect all
those incitements which are supposed to
influence the minds of soldiers; the love
of glory, the love of country, you count
as nothing. You address yourself to no
passion but one.—Fear is the only instrument
by which you compel your common
men to deeds of intrepidity.—Never mind
the instrument, replied the Prussian, but
look to the effect.</p>

<p>I am convinced, answered I, that British
soldiers, with that degree of discipline
which subsists in our army, which is not
near so rigid as yours, animated by their
native courage, and the interest which even
the common men take in all their country’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
quarrels, are at least equal to any other
troops.</p>

<p>I hope, said he, the experiment will
not be made soon, for I esteem your nation,
and should be sorry to see your troops
opposed to ours in the field: but till they
are, you cannot be sure of the justness of
your assertion. The advantages you gained
over the French in the late war rather
makes for my argument, because the French
army is more remiss in the article of discipline
than yours.</p>

<p>I then returned to my old ground, the
cruelty of harassing and tormenting men
without intermission; and asserted, that
the advantages arising from such excessive
severity, even though they should be as
great as he represented, could not form a
sufficient reason for rendering the lives of
so many men miserable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not know that they are miserable,
replied he—When men are but indifferently
fed, forced to perform very hard
duty, certain of being severely punished for
the smallest faults, and sometimes even for
their misfortunes, can you doubt, said I,
that these men are miserable?—They do
not seem miserable, replied he, they bear
it very well.—— And would you, added I,
have the less remorse in tormenting men,
because they have the strength of mind to
bear it well?</p>

<p>I then told him a story I had heard of
an English sailor, who was tried for a robbery
he had committed on the highway.
While his doom was pronouncing, he raised
a piece of rolled tobacco to his mouth,
and held it between his teeth till he heard
the sentence of death passed on him. He
then bit off a piece of the tobacco, and began
to chew it with great unconcern.
Sirrah, said the judge, piqued at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
man’s indifference, do you know that you
are to be hanged in a very short time?—So
I hear, said the sailor, squirting a little tobacco
juice from his mouth.—Do you
know, rejoined the judge, where you will
go when you die?—I cannot tell indeed,
an’t please your honour, said the sailor.—Why,
then, cried the judge, with a tremendous
voice, I will tell you: You will
go to hell, you villain, and there be burnt
to all eternity.—If I should, replied the
sailor, with perfect tranquillity, I hope,
my Lord, I shall be able to bear it.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXVIII">LETTER LXVIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>Berlin is certainly one of the most
beautiful cities in Europe. The streets
are built in a very regular manner, and of
a commodious breadth. In the new town
they are perfectly straight. Frederick-street
is reckoned two English miles and a
half, or a French league, in length. Others
which go off at right angles from that, are
a mile, or a mile and a half long.</p>

<p>Some people assert, that Berlin covers
as much ground as Paris. These are not
Frenchmen, as you will readily believe;
neither am I of that opinion, but it certainly
approaches much nearer to Paris in
size than in number of inhabitants; Berlin
is undoubtedly more than half the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of Paris, yet I am convinced it does not
contain above a fifth of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>There are a few very magnificent buildings
in this town. The rest are neat
houses, built of a fine white free-stone,
generally one, or at most two stories high.
Here, as at Potsdam, the finishing within
does not correspond with the elegance of
the outside, and the soldiers are quartered
on the ground-floor in rooms looking to the
street. The principal edifices are the
King’s palace, and that of Prince Henry.
Both of these are very magnificent. The
arsenal, which is a noble structure, is
built in the form of a square. We were
informed, that at present it contains arms
for 200,000 men. I am convinced this is
no exaggeration.</p>

<p>The new Roman Catholic church is by
far the most elegant place of worship in
the city. The King allows the free exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of every religion over all his dominions.
He thinks the smallest controul over men’s
consciences highly unjust. He even has
the delicacy not to influence them by his
example, and offends no religion, by giving
a preference to any one in particular.</p>

<p>On the front of the opera-house, which
is a very beautiful structure, is this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">FREDERICUS REX, APOLLINI ET MUSIS.</p>

<p>After observing the inscriptions and ornaments
of the palaces and other public
buildings, the new method of decorating
the churches, the number of Mercuries,
Apollos, Minervas, and Cupids, that are
to be met with in this country, a stranger
might be led to suspect, that the Christian
religion was exploded from the Prussian
dominions, and old Jupiter and his family
restored to their ancient honours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an equestrian statue of William,
the Great Elector, on the new bridge over
the Spree. This is highly esteemed as a
piece of fine workmanship.—In the corner
of one of the squares, is a statue of Marshal
Schwerin. He is represented holding the
ensign with which he advanced at the
famous battle of Prague.—Perceiving his
troops on the point of giving way, he
seized this from the officer’s hands whose
duty it was to carry it, and marched towards
the enemy, calling out, Let all but
cowards follow me. The troops, ashamed
to abandon their general, charged once
more, and turned the fortune of the day.—But
the brave old Marshal was killed, in
the eighty-fourth year of his age.—Do not
you think the trouble of living so long was
amply repaid by such a death?</p>

<p>Instead of saints or crucifixes, the King
intends, that the churches of Berlin shall
be ornamented with the portraits of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
who have been useful to the state. Those
of the Marshals Schwerin, Keith, Winterfield,
and some others, are already placed
in the great Lutheran church.</p>

<p>The society into which strangers may be
admitted in this capital, is not various or
extensive. The Prussian officers of the
higher ranks, whose time is not entirely
engrossed, like that of their inferiors, by
the duties of their profession, live mostly
with their own families, or with each
other. Exclusive of other reasons which
might determine them to this, it is understood,
that the King does not approve of
their forming intimacies with foreign ministers,
or with strangers.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— followed the King
to Magdeburg to see the reviews there, and
has since made a tour as far as Leipsic,
with two English gentlemen. My connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with him, and the letter I brought
from the Duchess of Brunswick, have procured
me invitations, which I should otherwise
have had but a small chance of receiving.
I passed a day lately at a very
pleasant villa, about six miles from Berlin,
belonging to the King’s brother, Prince
Ferdinand. He is married to a sister of
the Princess of Hesse Cassel’s. The Princess
of Prussia was there at the same time,
and Prince Frederick of Brunswick, with
his Princess, who is remarkably pretty.
I have the honour of supping sometimes
with Prince Frederick, who lives constantly
at Berlin. To the spirit and vivacity
common to all his family, he adds a taste
for poetry, and has composed some dramatic
pieces in the French language, which
have been represented on a little theatre in
his own house, and in private societies at
Berlin.—There has been a continued round
of feasting all the last week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess of Prussia gave a breakfast
at a garden in the Park, to which a large
company was invited. There was dancing,
which continued all the forenoon. Upon
all these occasions, I saw none of that state
and ceremony of which the Germans are
accused. Those of the highest rank behaved
with the greatest ease and affability
to every person present, and joined in the
country-dances, without observing any
form or etiquette.</p>

<p>The minister, Count Finkenstein, gave
a great dinner and ball, on account of the
marriage of one of his sons. The Count
Reuse, and some others, have also given
entertainments; but the chief and permanent
society is to be found at the houses of
the foreign ministers who reside here. I
have been introduced to all of them by Mr.
Harris, his Majesty’s envoy extraordinary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
who lives here in a style which does honour
to his country and himself.</p>

<p>We have received very great civilities also
from Baron Van Swieten, minister from,
the Court of Vienna, a man of wit and
erudition. He is son to the celebrated
physician, whose works are so highly
esteemed all over Europe. There are two
or three general officers who are pretty
often at the houses of these ministers, and
entertain strangers occasionally at home.—Besides
those I have named, there are very
few of the King of Prussia’s servants who
have any connection with the strangers that
come to Berlin. I have had the happiness
of forming an acquaintance here with two
very agreeable French gentlemen, the
Marquis de Laval, son of the Duke of
that name, and the Comte de Clermont,
grandson of that Mons. de Saint Hillaire,
whose arm was carried off by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
bullet which killed Marshal Turenne.
You remember the sentiment which St.
Hillaire expressed to his son, who lamented
his wound—A sentiment which proved,
that his magnanimity was equal to that of
the hero whom he so greatly preferred to
himself.</p>

<p class="right">Adieu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXIX">LETTER LXIX.</h2>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>When we arrived here first, the Queen
lived at Mont Bijou, a small palace
just without the gates. Her Majesty had
a public day twice a week while she remained
there; but she has lately removed
to Shoenhausen, another palace, situated
two leagues from Berlin, where she passes
the summer. Here she has a public day
only once a week. The Princes, the nobility,
the foreign ministers, and strangers,
generally attend on these occasions at five
in the evening. After her Majesty has
walked round the circle, and spoke a few
words to every one, she sits down to cards.
There is a table for the Queen, and one
for each of the Princesses, all of whom
choose their own parties. The rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
company present themselves for a few minutes
at each of these card-tables, after
which the duty of the day is over, and
they walk in the garden, or form parties
at cards in the other apartments, as they
think proper, and return to Berlin when it
begins to grow dark. On some particular
nights, her Majesty invites a considerable
number of the company to supper, who then
remain till midnight.</p>

<p>The Queen’s Court resembles the other
Courts of Europe; whereas that at Sans-Souci
is upon quite a new plan. No
strangers are received there, nor any other
persons, except such as have real business
with the King. There his Majesty is employed
in his affairs from morning till evening,
and spends the hours he destines for
relaxation in the company of two or three
men of letters, and a few officers, who
dine with him daily.—When he has business
with any of his servants, or with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
foreign ministers, which cannot be executed
by letter, they attend him at Sans-Souci,
and come away as soon as that business is
transacted.</p>

<p>Those assemblies at Shoenhausen are the
only established amusement for the ladies
of quality at Berlin during the summer;
but you have frequent opportunities of
meeting with the court ladies at the houses
of the foreign ministers.</p>

<p>The French manners and turn of thinking
certainly prevail very little among the
Prussian officers; but the ladies of the
court of Berlin have more the air of French
women, than those of any court I have
seen. Mademoiselle de Hartfield, first lady
of honour to the Queen, with an infinite
deal of wit, has all the ease and elegance
which distinguish the ladies of the Court of
Versailles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>His Majesty very seldom appears at the
Queen’s court, or at any place where
women form part of the assembly. When
he inclines to unbend, his amusements are
of a nature in which they can take no share.
I once said to a lady of this Court, that it
was a pity his Majesty did not love women.—Considering
his time of life, said she, we
could dispense with his love, but it is hard
that he cannot endure us.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this humour of the
King’s, the ladies here are by no means
neglected by the men in general. Many
of the married women particularly, have
avowed admirers, who attend them on all
occasions, are invited with them to all entertainments,
sit next them at table, and
whom the master or mistress of the feast
takes care to place in the same party with
them at cards. When a lady is not provided
with an attendant of this kind, her
husband, as well as herself, is generally a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
little out of countenance, and both seem
rather in an aukward situation, till this necessary
concomitant be found.</p>

<p>A misfortune of a very serious nature
happened lately to a certain gentleman
here; instead of expressing concern about
him or his wife (for he was a married
man), every body sympathized, in the tenderest
manner, with another lady, between
whom and this unfortunate gentleman the
most intimate connection was thought
to subsist: they said she was one of the
worthiest women in the world, and of such
delicate feelings, that her health might be
injured by the impression the gentleman’s
misfortune would make upon her mind—Being
surprised that no mention was made
of his wife all this time, I asked if she
might not also be in some measure affected
by her husband’s disaster?—I was told, that
she was otherwise occupied, and that any
thing which could happen to her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
was of little or no importance to her, I then
enquired if she and her husband lived on
bad terms; I was informed, that, on the
contrary, they were on the best footing in
the world, for that he was much attached
to another woman—(the very lady they so
greatly lamented) and that his wife was
entirely devoted to another man; so the
account between them being perfectly balanced,
they lived free of all domestic debates,
in a state of mutual neglect, and
engrossed with separate passions.</p>

<p>In this country, when both parties are
willing, and when there are no children,
a divorce may be obtained with very little
trouble or expence; we are frequently in
companies, where a lady, her present, and
former husband are at table, and all parties
behave in the most polite and friendly manner
to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>I have heard of one gentleman, who
having lived in a state of domestic jarring
with his wife, got her persuaded to concur
with him in applying for a divorce.—This
was soon obtained.—He then married
another woman, with whom he was
violently in love, and expected, as usual,
eternal happiness. After marriage, however,
this passion cooled rather sooner than
common, and within a few months he
became the professed admirer of his first
wife. He now saw a thousand charms in
her person and conversation, which had
entirely escaped his notice, while the bonds
of wedlock subsisted. He also discovered
that certain peculiarities in her manner,
which he had formerly thought exceedingly
aukward, were in reality graceful.
He expressed his remorse for his former
blindness in the most pathetic terms: the
lady was softened, and at length gave the
most perfect marks of forgiveness; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was universally thought, that he thus
contrived to live in adultery with the very
woman to whom he had been lawfully
married.</p>

<p>Here jealousy is held in equal contempt
and detestation, and scandal is very little
known. People seem so fully occupied
with their own private affairs, that they seldom
trouble their heads about the business
of their neighbours. If, in the course of
conversation, an intimacy of a particular
kind is hinted at between people of different
sexes, it is mentioned accidentally as a fact
of no importance, and without the smallest
blame or ill-natured reflection on either of
the parties. One reason of this may be, that
there is scarce such a thing (I am assured) as
an old maid in his Prussian Majesty’s dominions.</p>

<p>The most fashionable walk in Berlin, is
in the middle of one of the principal streets.—Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the houses on each side there is a
causeway, and between these two causeways
are fine gravel walks, planted with lime-trees.—Tents
are pitched under these, and
ice, lemonade, and other refreshments sold.
The bands of music belonging to the regiments
practise here in the summer.—The
Company generally are in the greatest number
in the evening, and often walk till it
is very late.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXX">LETTER LXX.</h2>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>Nothing surprised me more, when
I first came to Berlin, than the freedom
with which the people spoke of the
measures of government, and the conduct
of the King. I have heard political topics,
and others which I should have
thought still more ticklish, discussed here
with as little ceremony as at a London
coffee-house. The same freedom appears
in the booksellers’ shops, where literary
productions of all kinds are sold openly.
The pamphlet lately published on the division
of Poland, wherein the King is very
roughly treated, is to be had without difficulty,
as well as other performances,
which attack some of the most conspicuous
characters with all the bitterness of satire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>A government, supported by an army
of 180,000 men, may safely disregard the
criticisms of a few speculative politicians,
and the pen of the satirist. While his
Majesty retains the power of disposing of
the lives and properties of his subjects as
his wisdom shall direct, he allows them
the most perfect freedom to amuse themselves
with as many remarks or jokes on
his conduct as they please.</p>

<p>The mind of this monarch is infinitely
superior to that gossiping disposition, by
which the despicable race of whisperers
and retailers of scandal thrive at some
courts. Convinced that the same perfidy,
which can betray a real conversation, may
invent a false one, he listens to no little,
malicious tales of what has passed in private
companies, or during the hours of
convivial mirth. Any person who should
attempt to repeat anecdotes of this kind
to him, would be driven from his presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with disgrace. He treats with equal contempt
all anonymous letters, and every
kind of injurious information, when the
informer declines appearing openly in support
of his assertions.</p>

<p>This great Prince is so perfectly devoid
of suspicion and personal fear, that he resides
at Sans-Souci without any guard
whatever. An orderly serjeant, or corporal
only, attends there in the day-time
to carry occasional orders to the garrison
at Potsdam, whither he always returns in
the evening. In this house, where the
King sleeps every night, there are not
above ten or a dozen persons, the servants
included. When you recollect that Sans-Souci
is a solitary mansion, about half a
league from Potsdam, where all the guards
are shut up, and therefore could be of no
manner of use, in case of any attempt on
the King’s person during the night; when
you consider that he, who lies thus defenceless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and exposed, is a despotic monarch,
who governs by the dictates of his
own will and understanding, without minding
the ill-humour or discontent of any
man, or any set of men, and who, no
doubt, has many inveterate enemies, you
must confess, that all these circumstances
argue great magnanimity.</p>

<p>Berlin, though not a fortified, is certainly
a very military town. When all the
soldiers of the garrison are present, they
amount to 30,000. In their general conduct
they are quiet, and the police of the town is
pretty well regulated. Yet there are some
kinds of irregularities which prevail in the
highest degree. Public courtezans are more
numerous here than in any town in Europe,
in proportion to the number of inhabitants.
They appear openly at the windows
in the day-time, beckon to passengers
as they walk in the streets, and ply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for employment in any way they please,
without disturbance from the magistrate.</p>

<p>It seems to be a received opinion here,
that the peace and happiness of the community
are not interrupted by this species
of licentiousness; or perhaps it is believed,
that an attempt to restrain it would be attended
with consequences worse than the
thing itself. Therefore nobody is allowed
to molest or abuse those who have chosen
this for a trade, and as little attention is
paid to customers, who frequent the chambers
of those ladies, as if they stept into
any other house or shop, to purchase any
other commodity.</p>

<p>Another species of debauchery is said to
prevail in this capital.—I imagine, however,
that what is related on that nauseous
subject is greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The better kind of citizens and manufacturers
live entirely among those of their
own rank, and without affecting the manners
of the courtiers, or stooping to the
mean debauchery of the commonalty, maintain
the decency, plainness, and honesty of
the German character.</p>

<p>His Prussian Majesty has applied his attention
to no object with so much zeal, and
so little success, as to the establishing of
commerce in his dominions. All his efforts,
in order to this, have been rendered
abortive by injudicious taxes, by monopolies,
and other restrictions. Commerce,
like the wild commoners of the air and the
forest, when confined or shackled, immediately
droops and dwindles, or, being
alarmed, like Love,</p>

<p class="right">Berlin.</p>

<p>I thank you, Sir, for the poem and
pamphlets you sent me by ——. I
own I do not think the former a very capital
performance; yet am not surprised at
the great run it has had. For though it
had contained still a smaller proportion of
wit, it would have been a good deal relished
on account of the malignity and
personal abuse with which it abounds.</p>

<p>The English nation have always had a
great appetite for political writings; but
those who cater for them have of late
served up such messes of mere politics, as
seem at length to have turned their stomachs.
A little wit or personal satire is
now found necessary to make even a newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
go down. The first is not always
at the command of the caterer: he therefore
uses the other in its place, which answers
his purpose as well.</p>

<p>I never had any delight in contemplating
or exposing the dark side of human nature;
but there are some shades so obvious,
that you cannot open your eyes without
observing them. The satisfaction that
many people enjoy in reading libels, wherein
private characters are traduced, is of
that number. If to be abused in pamphlets
and news-papers is considered as adversity,
the truth of Rochefoucault’s maxim
is uncontrovertible:—Dans l’adversité
de nos meilleurs amis, nous trouvons toujours
quelquechose qui ne nous déplait
pas.</p>

<p>The common scribblers of the age have
turned to their own account this malevolent
disposition, which they perceive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
be so prevalent among men.—Like the
people who provide bulls and other animals
to be baited by dogs for the amusement of
the spectators, these gentlemen turn out
a few characters every week to be mangled
and torn in the most cruel manner in the
public news-papers.</p>

<p>It is the savage taste of those who pay for
these amusements, which keeps them in
use. The writers of scurrilous books in
London often bear no more malice to the
individuals they abuse, than the people at
Paris and Vienna, who provide the other
horrid amusement, bear to the boars, bulls,
and other animals which they expose to
the fury of dogs.</p>

<p>As for the scribblers, they seldom have
any knowledge of the persons whose characters
they attack. It is far from being
impossible, that the author of the severe
verses you sent me, has no more acquaintance
with the lords and gentlemen against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
whom he writes with such bitterness,
than the weaver who wove their pocket-handkerchiefs.
The motive for the fabrication
of the one as well as the other
commodity most probably was daily bread,
and this poetaster has preferred satire to
panegyric, merely because he knew the first
was most to the taste of his customers.</p>

<p>I remember once to have been in a certain
bookseller’s shop, when a letter was
delivered to him, inclosing a paper, which,
after he had thrown his eyes over it, he
presented to me, telling me it was a
character of Lord S——, which he intended
to insert in a certain work then
publishing.—I fancy, added he, it will do
pretty well; the author is a sharp blade,
I assure you;—none of my boys carry such
an edge, or cut so deep, as that little gladiator.</p>

<p>I found this a most bitter invective
against the above-mentioned nobleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
written with all the inveteracy of malice
and personal enmity, branding him as a
prodigy of sensuality, and accusing him of
every villanous disposition and propensity
that ever tainted the most corrupt heart.</p>

<p>This, said I, is a much more harmless
production than is intended. The violence
of this poison will prove its own antidote.
The most voracious stomach for slander
and defamation will not be able to bear
such a dose, but must reject it with disgust.
Every reader of common understanding
will clearly perceive, that all this
abuse has been dictated by malice and personal
resentment.</p>

<p>Then, replied the bookseller, every reader
of common understanding will clearly perceive
what does not exist; for the writer
of that paper, to my certain knowledge,
never had the smallest intercourse or connection
with Lord S——; never bore him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
any ill-will, and has not the most distant
wish to injure that noble Lord; as a proof
of which, added he, taking another paper
out of his drawer, here is a character of
the same nobleman, written by the same
author, which is to appear about a week
after the publication of the former, by way
of answer to it.</p>

<p>This second paper was a continued eulogium
on Lord S—— from beginning to
end, in which the candid author, having
compared him to some of the greatest and
most celebrated men, and having collected
many of the brightest flowers, with which
Plutarch has adorned his worthies, he
forms them into one large wreath, which
he very seriously binds round the English
nobleman’s brow, concluding with this
observation. That as his Lordship resembled
them in their virtues, so like them
he had been distinguished by the most virulent
attacks of envy and malice, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
was a tax that had always been paid for
superior talents.</p>

<p>How comes my Lord S——, said I to
the bookseller, to be selected from his brethren
of the peerage, and distinguished
so remarkably by the obloquy and the
praise of your ingenious friend?</p>

<p>Because, replied he, that nobleman is at
the head of an active department, and is
one of those vigorous and decisive characters,
which never fail to create a number
of enemies and of friends. His enemies
are delighted to see him abused, and it is
expected, that his friends will be charmed
to hear him praised; and, between the
two, my friend’s productions will find a
brisk sale, and I hope to make a tolerable
job of his Lordship; which, let me tell
you, cannot be done with every man of
rank.—Lord, Sir! there are some of them
of such mawkish, water-gruel characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
as to interest no mortal. There is
——, a man of such high
rank and such a known name, that I
thought something might have been made
of him:—And so I employed my little
Drawcansir for and against him, and two
very pretty pamphlets he produced;—but
just as I was going to send them to the
press, I happened to shew them to a
friend of mine, who is an admirable judge
in these matters.—These pamphlets, says
he, are very well wrote; but they’ll never
pay the printing. The person who is the
subject of them is of such a cold, tame,
civil, cautious disposition, and has balanced
so exactly through the whole of
his life, that he has never obliged or disobliged
any one. He has neither friend
nor foe in the world:—Every body says, he
is a good enough sort of a man; but were
he to break his neck to-night, no human
creature would feel either sorrow or satisfaction
at the event, and a satire or panegyric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
on his grandmother would be as
much read as those written on him.</p>

<p>In faith, sir, concluded the Bookseller, I
took the hint, and so the pamphlets never
appeared.</p>

<p>Though I was a good deal entertained
with my friend the Bookseller’s reasoning,
yet I could not help feeling indignation at
the literary bravo, who lived in this infamous
manner, by wounding and murdering,
or at least attempting to murder,
people’s reputations. And those are not
entirely free from blame, who detesting
the writer, take pleasure in the writings.
He has very possibly the plea of necessitous
circumstances to urge in alleviation of his
wickedness:—but the pleasure they take
seems to proceed from a pure, disinterested
fondness of seeing others abused. Many
of those who cry shame on the licentiousness
of the press, and exclaim against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
injustice and cruelty of tearing private characters
to pieces in public papers, have the
most virulent of these productions served
up every morning as regularly as their
toast and butter. If they would forego the
pleasure of reading the most malicious of
those compositions, the evil they complain
of would cease directly.</p>

<p>But it is ridiculous, and seems ungrateful,
for people to affect an appearance of
indignation against those who provide for
them one of the greatest enjoyments of
their lives. To chuckle over scandal all
the forenoon with every mark of pleasure,
and decry it in the evening with affected
anger, is as preposterous as it would be in a
judge, first to seduce a poor wench to fornication,
and then punish her for the sin.</p>

<p>You may possibly retort upon me, by
putting me in mind of the admiration I
expressed of the style of certain celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
letters, wherein some eminent characters
are dissected, and tortured with the scientific
skill of an anatomist, and the refined cruelty
of an inquisitor. I answer, that I admired
the wit and genius, but not the disposition
displayed in those letters.</p>

<p>Malice, when introduced by genius
and wit, is often tolerated on account of
the respect due to the introducers; but
when the wretch comes alone, or is accompanied
by dulness, which often happens,
she will be expelled with infamy
from all good company.</p>

<p>The Prussian army at present, according
to my information, consists of
180,000 men. If twenty, or even thirty
thousand are deducted from this account,
on the supposition that it is exaggerated,
still the remainder will be very great;
and the expence of such an establishment
in time of peace, seems to many almost incompatible
with the King of Prussia’s resources.
Although the revenues of this
monarch are much greater than is generally
imagined, yet the armies he has supported,
and continues to support; the palace
he has built, and other expensive undertakings
which he has completed, are not
such proofs of the greatness of his revenue,
as of the prudence with which it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
managed. Many other Princes have greater
revenues, which, like water spilt on uncultivated
land, and assisting the growth of
useless weeds, are dissipated without taste
or magnificence on the trumpery of a
court and their dependents. Perhaps it was
never known what miracles, œconomy, and
assiduity through all the departments of
government could perform, till this monarch
made it apparent.</p>

<p>In the King of Prussia’s dominions, there
are none of those polls which enrich individuals
at the expence of the public;
places suited to the abilities and the luxury
of the great, where the salary is large, because
the application and talents requisite
are small. If those who hold the most lucrative
places in this court, can support a
becoming dignity by the emoluments of
their office, and lay up a very moderate
provision for their families, it is the utmost
they ever expect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>All commodities are highly taxed in the
Prussian dominions. At Berlin, though
money is a great deal scarcer than at London
or Paris, a stranger will find very little
difference in the ordinary expence of living.
There are no means by which his revenue
can be augmented, which this King has not
tried. He has taxed even the vanity of his
subjects, and drawn considerable supplies
since the beginning of his reign from that
plentiful source. The rage which the Germans,
above all men, have for titles,
prompts many of the wealthy citizens to
purchase that of some office about court;
and although the King employs no person
void of abilities, he never scruples to permit
this kind of traffic. The title, however,
is literally all that is sold, for with regard
to the real business of the office, the
purchaser has as little connection with
it after the bargain as before. Though
his Majesty scarcely ever consults with
any body, he has more nominal privy-counsellors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
than any King in Christendom.</p>

<p>The taxes in general are invariably fixed;
but methods are found of drawing contributions
from the proprietors of the very
great estates, which do not affect the
smaller landlords, or the rest of the subjects.
The spirit of the government is
not favourable to great and independent
Lords. But both the great and the small
landlords are prevented from squeezing or
oppressing the peasants. As the soldiery
are drawn from them, care is taken that
they shall not be deprived of the chief
source of health and vigour, and there is
no peasantry in Europe better fed than the
Prussian.</p>

<p>The army is chiefly composed of provincial
regiments. The whole Prussian
dominions being divided into circles or
cantons; in each of these, one or more regiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in proportion to the size and populousness
of the division, have been originally
raised, and from it the recruits continue
to be taken; and each particular regiment
is always quartered, in the time of
peace, near the canton from which its recruits
are drawn.</p>

<p>Whatever number of sons a peasant may
have, they are all liable to be taken into
the service except one, who is left to assist
in the management of the farm. The rest
wear badges from their childhood, to mark
that they are destined to be soldiers, and
ready to serve when the state requires them.
If a peasant has only one son, he is not
forced into the service, except he has the
misfortune to be uncommonly stout and
well-made. The King, however, endeavours
to save his own peasantry, and draw
as many recruits as he can from other
countries:—For this purpose, there are
Prussian officers employed at Hamburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Frankfort, and other free towns of Germany.
I have seen them also at Neufchatel,
and at places near French garrisons,
attempting to inlist men, and pick up deserters.
The recruits procured in this manner,
remain continually with the regiments
in which they are placed; but the native
Prussians have every year eight or nine
months of furlough, during which they
return to their fathers’ or brothers’ houses,
and work at the business of the farm, or
gain their livelihood in any other way they
please. Here is at once an immense saving
in the expence of the army, and a great
gain to the state from the labour of so many
men.</p>

<p>From this it appears, that the Prussian
army is neither more nor less than a standing
militia, embodied for two or three
months every year, and then dispersed to
their usual labours as farmers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>I think this decides our old dispute on
the subject of standing armies and militia.
I expert therefore that you will, by the return
of post, fairly and candidly acknowledge
that I was in the right, and that all
your arguments to prove, that a militia
could not be depended on in the time of
actual service, are built on false principles,
and that my opinion was just and well-founded.</p>

<p>Before closing this letter, I will inform
you of a very singular incident, the circumstances
of which I relate, not so much
with a design to illustrate the character or
sentiments of the vulgar of this place in
particular, as to furnish you with a curious
fact in the history of human nature in
general.</p>

<p>I went a few days since with Mr. F——
to see a man executed for the murder of a
child.—His motives for this horrid deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
were much more extraordinary than the
action itself. He had accompanied some
of his companions to the house of a fellow,
who assumed the character of a fortune-teller,
and having disobliged him, by expressing
a contempt of his art, the fellow,
out of revenge, prophesied, that this man
should die on a scaffold.—This seemed to
make little impression at the time, but afterwards
recurred often to this unhappy
creature’s memory, and became every day
more troublesome to his imagination. At
length the idea haunted his mind so incessantly,
that he was rendered perfectly
miserable, and could no longer endure
life.</p>

<p>He would have put himself to death with
his own hands, had he not been deterred
by the notion, that God Almighty never
forgave suicide; though, upon repentance,
he is very ready to pardon every other
crime. He resolved, therefore, to commit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
murder, that he might be deprived of life
by the hands of justice; and mingling a
sentiment of benevolence with the cruelty
of his intention, he reflected, that if he
murdered a grown person, he might possibly
send a soul to hell. To avoid this, he
determined to murder a child, who could
not have committed any sin which deserved
damnation, but dying in innocence,
would go immediately to Heaven. In
consequence of these ideas, he actually
murdered an infant of his master’s, for
whom he had always shewn an uncommon
degree of fondness. Such was the strange
account which this infatuated creature gave
on his trial;—and thus the random prophecy
proved, as in many other cases, the
cause of its own completion.</p>

<p>He was executed about two miles from
Berlin. As soon as he ascended the scaffold,
he took off his coat and waistcoat;—his
shirt was rolled down below his shoulders;—his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
night-cap was pulled over his eyes;—he
was placed on his knees, and the executioner
with a single stroke of a broad
sword severed his head from his body.—It
was the first time this executioner had performed:—there
were two others of the
same trade on the scaffold, who exhibited
an instance of insensibility more shocking
than the execution.—While the man’s head
rolled on the scaffold, and the arteries of the
trunk poured out their blood, those men,
with the gayest air you can imagine, shook
their brother by the hand, wished him joy,
and clapped him on the back, congratulating
him on the dexterous and effectual manner
in which he had performed his office.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— having expressed
an inclination to visit the court of
Mecklenburg Strelitz, I accompanied him
thither soon after his return from Magdeburg
and Leipsic. The weather being sultry,
his Grace thought that travelling in
the night would be most agreeable. We
did not set out therefore till about six or
seven in the evening. The first post-house
is four German miles from Berlin; but as
great part of the road is through a large
wood, and the night became very dark,
the postillions lost their way. In a short
time we were perfectly bewildered, and
without the smallest notion which direction
we should follow. After many ineffectual
attempts to find out the path, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
thought it would be most prudent to unyoke
the horses, and allow them to graze around,
while we slept in the chaise till daybreak.
This plan was literally followed:
as soon as the servants, by the light of the
rising sun, had discovered the path, we
proceeded by Oranienburg and Seidneek
to Reinsburg, which is a magnificent castle
belonging to Prince Henry of Prussia.</p>

<p>The gardens here are very extensive, and
have been highly improved and ornamented
by this Prince, who has a good taste, and
a magnificent turn of mind.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the town of New
Strelitz, we were informed that the court
was at Brandenburg. The Ducal residence
was formerly at Old Strelitz; but the
palace there, with all the magnificent furniture
and effects, was burnt to ashes about
fifty years ago. The fire having broke out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in the night-time, the family themselves
had a very narrow escape.</p>

<p>A new palace has been since built at the
distance of two English miles from where
the former stood, but in a much more
agreeable situation, being placed on a
gentle eminence near a fine lake; and the
town of New Strelitz has gradually arisen
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>After a short stay at Strelitz, we proceeded
to New Brandenburg, which is some
leagues farther north, and within a small
distance of the Baltic. We arrived there
in the morning of the third day after we
had left Berlin. When the Chamberlain of
the Court was informed of the D—— of
H——’s arrival, we received an invitation
to dinner, and a coach and equipage were
ordered to attend his Grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The reigning Duke of Mecklenburg
Strelitz is unmarried, as well as the Princess,
his sister, who lives constantly with
him. They are both of a darker complexion
than the Queen of Great Britain,
and neither of them so tall; nor have they
much external resemblance of her Majesty,
except in the affability of their manner.
The Duke is beloved by his subjects, on
account of the humanity and benevolence
of his disposition, which seem to be characteristic
of the whole family.—After
dinner there was a concert of music, and
card-playing till supper.</p>

<p>The whole country of Mecklenburg was
for many centuries under the government
of one Prince. In the year 1592, on the
death of the Sovereign, it was divided between
his two sons. The eldest retaining
the Duchy of Mecklenburg Schwerin,
which is considerably the largest share; the
younger obtained the Duchy of Mecklenburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Strelitz. This last branch became
extinct in the year 1695, and Duke Frederic
William, of the eldest branch, laid
claim to the inheritance of the Duchy of
Strelitz. But he was opposed by Adolphus
Frederic, his father’s younger brother, and
the contest was settled by compromise between
the parties in 1701. The right of
primogeniture, and the lineal succession,
were then established in both houses, and
this final agreement was ratified by the
Emperor.</p>

<p>The country here is not a sandy flat, as
around Berlin; but the soil becomes gradually
better as you move from that city,
and around New Brandenburg it is remarkably
fertile. Though the southern
border of this Duchy is flat, sandy and barren,
yet all the northern part is of a rich
verdure, finely diversified with hills, meadows,
woods, and several beautiful lakes
from four to ten miles in length. The country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
yields plenty of corn, hemp, flax, excellent
pasture for numerous flocks of sheep,
and a good breed of horses.—New Brandenburg
is a neat and thriving town, very
agreeably situated. The inhabitants carry
on a considerable trade in hops, which grow
in great abundance all around.</p>

<p>This country, which seems to be happy
in its prince and other particulars, cannot
rank among its blessings the neighbourhood
of so great and warlike a monarch as the
King of Prussia. In the course of the late
war, both the Mecklenburgs suffered very
severely from this circumstance. The Russians
and Austrians, who pillaged the middle
Mark of Brandenburg, did not ascertain
with nicety where the King of Prussia’s dominions
ended, and the Duke of Strelitz’s
began; but as often as there was any thing
valuable to carry away, plundered both
without distinction. And when that Monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
himself was driven to extremity, and
obliged to use every means of recruiting his
army, the Mecklenburghers were cajoled
and seduced by every art into the Prussian
service; and when these methods failed, they
were, as it is said, taken by force. Even
at present, whenever the Prussian recruiting
officers know of a strong well-looking peasant
belonging to the Duchy of Mecklenburg,
they use every means they can devise
to seduce him into their master’s service.—Complaints
are frequently made of these
practices to his Prussian Majesty, and redress
will be given when it shall please the
Lord.</p>

<p>The second day after our arrival, we
spent the forenoon in viewing every thing
worthy of notice in the town, and dined
again at court, where there was a more numerous
company than had been the first
day. After dinner we accompanied his
Highness and the Princess to an assembly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the town, and returned to sup at the court.
During supper there was a concert of vocal
and instrumental music.</p>

<p>Having received every mark of polite attention
from this Prince, we took leave of
him and the Princess, and left the town early
next morning, and returned by Old Strelitz,
which is not in such a flourishing condition,
or situated in so fine a country, as
New Brandenburg. While British subjects
pass through this country, they will naturally
reflect with gratitude and veneration
on the character of a Princess whose virtues
are an ornament to the British throne, and
whose amiable manners and prudent conduct
have united the affections of a people
divided by party, and irreconcilable in sentiment
on almost every other subject.</p>

<p>On our return to Berlin, I found a letter
from Lord Marechal, informing me, that
the King was expected at Potsdam within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a very few days; that great preparations
were making for the reception of the Princess
of Hesse and the Duchess of Wurtemberg,
who were then both at Berlin,
and were to pay a visit to the King at
Sans-Souci; that they would be accompanied
by the Princess Amelia, the King’s
unmarried sister, and his two sisters-in-law,
for all of whom apartments were
preparing at the new palace, where his
majesty also was to reside all the time that
his illustrious guests should remain. My
Lord added, that the celebrated Le Kain,
and a company of French comedians, were
already arrived, and also a company of
Italian actors and singers for the opera;
and that both companies were to perform
at the theatre within the palace; that a
great concourse of company was expected
at Potsdam on the occasion; that most of
the apartments in the town were already
bespoke, and, as he imagined we should
incline to be there, he had engaged lodgings
for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke was extremely pleased with
this obliging behaviour of Lord Marechal.
I afterwards spoke to Mr. Harris on this
subject, and enquired if he intended to be
at Potsdam on the occasion? He told me,
that as the plays, operas, and other entertainments,
were to be given in the palace,
nobody could attend them except those
who had particular invitations; that neither
he nor any of the foreign ministers had
been, or, as he understood, were to be
invited, nor did he hear that any strangers
were expected;—and that he imagined it
would be unbecoming the D—— of H——
to be at Potsdam at that time, except he
could with propriety attend the entertainments
at Sans-Souci.</p>

<p>His Grace, on hearing this account,
determined to remain here; but some days
after, I received a letter from Count Finkenstein,
acquainting me, that he had
orders to invite the D—— of H—— and me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to attend the entertainments to be given at
Sans-Souci. This afforded us great satisfaction,
not so much on account of the
public entertainments, as because it will
give us opportunities, which we could not
otherwise have, of seeing the King of
Prussia, and probably in an easier way
than at Berlin. As for the usual amusements
and splendor of courts, his Grace
displays more coolness about them than
one would naturally imagine, considering
the manner in which he is received, his
time of life, and his personal appearance.</p>

<p>Since our return from Mecklenburg,
we have passed our time almost constantly
with Mr. Harris, who accompanied the
Duke yesterday on his last visit to Shoenhausen;
for we shall probably not return
to this place from Potsdam. Mr. F—— set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
out a few days ago for Frankfort on the
Maine; his easy humour, and original
turn of thought, make his absence felt
with pain by all who have tasted the pleasure
of his conversation.</p>

<p class="right">Adieu.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXIV">LETTER LXXIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>We have been here about a fortnight.
His Majesty arrived at the new palace
of Sans-Souci about the same time
that we came to Potsdam. The Princess
Amelia, who is mistress of the ceremonies,
was there to receive him. The company
I formerly mentioned are all lodged in the
palace, I will give you a short sketch of
what has passed.</p>

<p>There has been a theatrical entertainment
every second or third day. His
Grace and I attend at Sans-Souci on
these days only. We drive from Potsdam
about five in the evening. The company
assemble in one of the apartments of the
palace about that time, and walk to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
playhouse a little before six. The theatre
is very well contrived for the accommodation
of a small audience. There are
neither boxes nor pit; but semicircular
benches in the front of the stage. The
foremost bench is upon the floor; the
others rise gradually behind, that all the
spectators may see equally well.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the company are
placed, the Royal Family arrive. The
Princess Amelia is led in by Prince Frederick
of Brunswick, and the Princess of
Hesse by the King. The Duchess of
Wurtemberg, and the other Princesses, are
led in after; they, and the ladies their
attendants, sit in the first rows. The
King generally seats himself in the third
or fourth. The piece then begins, and
is usually finished about nine, after which
all the company return to the large apartment,
where the King remains conversing
in a familiar manner till supper is ready.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
He then retires, and goes to bed at
ten.</p>

<p>Those whom the Princess Amelia
orders to be invited, stay to supper;
and there is generally a pretty numerous
company.—We have been at this repast
three or four times, and usually get
to our lodgings at Potsdam about midnight.</p>

<p>Hitherto there have been no comedies
acted, and I understand there are to be
none, because Le Kain never acts in comedy;
and for another reason, which is
equivalent to a thousand,—his Majesty
loves tragedy better.</p>

<p>Le Kain has already appeared in some of
his principal characters.—You need not
doubt of his exerting all his powers before
such an audience.—I might have said,
such an auditor. The King seemed pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
with his acting, and of consequence the
courtiers were in raptures, and vied with
each other who should praise him most.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Oedipus is his Majesty’s
favourite piece. This has been represented
twice, and he seemed to enjoy it very
much on both occasions; particularly when
the following speech against priests was
pronounced:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">Tandis que par vos soins vous pouvez tout apprendre,</div>
<div class="verse">Quel besoin que le Ciel ici se fasse entendre?</div>
<div class="verse">Ces Dieux, dont le pontife a promis le secours,</div>
<div class="verse">Dans leus temples, Seigneur, n’habitent pas toujours;</div>
<div class="verse">On ne voit point leur bras si prodigue en miracles;</div>
<div class="verse">Ces antres, ces trépieds, qui rendent leurs oracles,</div>
<div class="verse">Ces organes d’airain que nos mains ont formés,</div>
<div class="verse">Toujours d’un souffle pur ne sont point animés.</div>
<div class="verse">Ne nous endormons point sur la foi de leurs prêtres;</div>
<div class="verse">Au pied du sanctuaire il est souvent des traîtres,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui nous asservissant sous un pouvoir sacré,</div>
<div class="verse">Font parler les destins, les font taire à leur gré.</div>
<div class="verse">Voyez, examinez, avec un soin extrême,</div>
<div class="verse">Philoctète, Phorbas, &amp; Jocaste elle-même.</div>
<div class="verse">Ne nous fions qu’à nous, voyons tout par nos yeux,</div>
<div class="verse">Ce sont là nos trépieds, nos oracles, nos Dieux.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>And afterwards, when Jocasta pours
forth another tirade of the same kind, which
terminates with these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Nos Prêtres ne sont point ce qu’un vain peuple pense;</div>
<div class="verse">Notre crédulité fait toute leur science.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I happened to sit next to the Abbé
Bastiani, and, while the actress spoke this,
the king started up, coughed, and laughed,
with very significant gestures, to the ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>But though these passages, and some
others, seem at first sight to be severe
against priests, the tragedy of Oedipus,
upon the whole, does them great honour.
For all that is said against them, turns out
to be unjust, and it appears that the oracle,
which had been treated in such severe
terms, was true, and that the high priest
had acted throughout like an honest and
virtuous man. It surprises me, therefore,
that Voltaire should have taken the plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of his play from the Greek tragedy on
this subject, which has constrained him,
like Balaam the son of Barak, to do honour
to those whom he would have been
better pleased to have cursed.—And the
King on his part (if I may presume to
say it) could not have pitched upon a tragedy
less à-propos, if his intention was to
turn the clergy into ridicule.</p>

<p>I have no objection to this piece, on
account of the honour done to the clergy;
because I cannot help forming an opinion
of men from my own experience: And I
have known so many good men of that
profession, that I should respect it on their
account, exclusive of other reasons.</p>

<p>But I own I have the misfortune not to
follow this great monarch, and many other
respectable critics, in their admiration of
the tragedy of Oedipus.—The fable, in my
poor opinion, is too horrible.—The circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of Oedipus being married to his
mother, and having children by her, is
highly disgusting; and the idea it gives of
Providence and the conduct of the gods,
cannot have a good effect on the mind.
Nothing could be more unjust, than that
Heaven should send a plague among the
inhabitants of Thebes, and pour such
vengeance on poor Oedipus and Jocasta,
for crimes of which it knew them to be
innocent. We cannot help admitting the
justice of Oedipus’s reproaches against the
gods, when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">Le voilà donc rempli cet oracle exécrable,</div>
<div class="verse">Dont ma crainte a pressé l’effet inévitable:</div>
<div class="verse">Et je me vois enfin, par un mélange affreux,</div>
<div class="verse">Inceste, &amp; parricide, &amp; pourtant vertueux.</div>
<div class="verse">Miserable vertu, nom stérile &amp; funeste,</div>
<div class="verse">Toi par qui j’ai réglé des jours que je déteste,</div>

<div class="verse">Impitoyables dieux, mes crimes sont les vôtres,</div>
<div class="verse">Et vous m’en punissez.…</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We must suspect, however, that Jocasta
has mistaken in the opinion she utters in
the concluding lines of the tragedy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">Prêtres, &amp; vous Thébains, qui futes mes sujets,</div>
<div class="verse">Honorez mon bucher, &amp; songez à jamais,</div>

<div class="verse">J’ai fait rougir les dieux, qui m’ont forcée au crime.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For those, who could force innocent people
to commit criminal actions, and then
punish them on that account, were not
capable of blushing for any thing. A
French tragedy and Italian opera are represented
at this theatre alternately; the
King attends the latter as punctually as
the former, and displays in his countenance
that extreme sensibility to music,
which forms part of his character. I imagine
this Prince would succeed better in
any thing than in simulation, if he should
ever think it worth his while to attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
that part of hypocrisy,—his features are so
expressive of his feelings, that the first
would be constantly in danger of betraying
the other. When there is no representation
at the theatre, his Majesty has
a private concert in his own apartment,
where he himself performs on the German
flute, in which instrument he has attained
the highest degree of excellence.—To these
concerts no stranger is admitted.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXV">LETTER LXXV.</h2>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>When we first arrived here, there
was nothing I was so eager to see
as the Prussian troops at their exercise; but
the reviews at Berlin have completely satiated
my curiosity. And though the gardens
of the palace are just opposite to the
windows of our inn, I hardly ever go to
look at the guards, who are paraded there
every forenoon.—A few days ago, however,
I happened to take a very early walk
about a mile out of town, and seeing some
soldiers under arms, in a field at a small
distance from the road, I went towards
them. An officer on horseback, whom I
took to be the Major, for he gave the
word of command, was uncommonly active,
and often rode among the ranks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
reprimand, or instruct, the common men.
When I came nearer, I was much surprised
to find that this was the king himself.
He had his sword drawn, and continued to
exercise the corps for an hour after. He
made them wheel, march, form the square,
and fire by divisions, and in platoons, observing
all their motions with infinite attention;
and, on account of some blunder,
put two officers of the Prince of Prussia’s
regiment in arrest.—In short, he seemed to
exert himself with all the spirit of a young
officer, eager to attract the notice of his
General by uncommon alertness.</p>

<p>I expressed my surprise to an officer present,
that the King was not willing to take
some repose, particularly from that kind
of employment of which he had had so
very much of late, and that he could take
so much pains with a mere handful of men
immediately after he had come from exercising
whole armies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>This gentleman told me, that, on this
particular day, the King had been trying
some new evolutions; but though this had
not been the case, he might very possibly
have been in the field:—for his maxim
was, that his troops should display as
much briskness on a common field-day as
if they were to engage in battle; and
therefore it was never known when he intended
to be present, or when not;—that
as for repose, he took it between ten at
night and four in the morning, and his
other hours were all devoted to action,
either of body or mind, or both; and that
the exercise he had just taken, was probably
by way of relaxation after three hours previous
labour in his cabinet.</p>

<p>The more I see and hear of this extraordinary
man, the more am I astonished. He
reconciles qualities which I used to think
incompatible. I once was of opinion, that
the mind, which stoops to very small objects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
is incapable of embracing great ones;—I
am now convinced, that he is an exception;
for while few objects are too great
for his genius, none seem too small for his
attention.</p>

<p>I once thought that a man of much vivacity
was not capable of entering into the
detail of business:—I now see that he, who
is certainly a man of wit, can continue
methodically the necessary routine of business,
with the patience and perseverance of
the greatest dunce that ever drudged in a
compting-house.</p>

<p>Since my last, we have seen the Italians
perform; but neither the plays nor the
operas, nor any part of the entertainments,
interest me half so much, or could draw
me so assiduously to Sans-Souci, as the opportunity
this attendance gives of seeing
the King. Other monarchs acquire importance
from their station; this Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
gives importance to his. The traveller
in other countries has a wish to see the
King, because he admires the kingdom:—here
the object of curiosity is reversed:—and
let us suppose the palaces, and the
towns, and the country, and the army of
Prussia ever so fine, yet our chief interest in
them will arise from their belonging to
Frederic the Second;—the man, who,
without an ally but Britain, repelled the
united force of Austria, France, Russia,
and Sweden.</p>

<p>Count Nesselrode, talking with me on
this subject, had an expression equally lively
and just: C’est dans l’adversité qu’il
brille, lorsqu’il est bien comprimé il a un
ressort irrésistible.</p>

<p>The evening of the day on which I had
seen the King in the field, I was at Sans-Souci;
for I wish to neglect no opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of being present where this monarch is. I
like to stand near him, to hear him speak,
and to observe his movements, attitudes,
and most indifferent actions. He always
behaves with particular affability to the
D—— of H——. One evening, before
the play began, his Grace and I were
standing accidentally with Count Finkenstein,
in a room adjoining to the great
apartment where the company were. The
King entered alone, when he was not expected,
and immediately began a conversation
with the D——.</p>

<p>He asked several questions relating to the
British constitution; particularly at what
age a peer could take his seat in parliament?—When
the Duke replied, At twenty-one.—It
is evident from that, said the
King, that the English Patricians acquire
the necessary talents for legislation much
sooner than those of ancient Rome, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
were not admitted into the Senate till the
age of forty.</p>

<p>He then enquired about the state of Lord
Chatham’s health, and expressed high
esteem for the character of that minister.—He
asked me, if I had received letters by
the last post, and if they mentioned any
thing of the affairs in America?—He said,
there were accounts from Holland, that
the English troops had been driven from
Boston, and that the Americans were in
possession of that place.—— I told him, our
letters informed us, that the army had
left Boston to make an attack with more
effect elsewhere.</p>

<p>He smiled, and said—If you will not
allow the retreat to have been an affair of
necessity, you will at least admit, that it
was <i>tout-à-fait à propos</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>He said he heard that some British officers
had gone into the American service,
and mentioned Colonel Lee, whom he
had seen at his Court. He observed, that
it was a difficult thing to govern men
by force at such a distance;—that if the
Americans should be beat (which appeared
a little problematical), still it
would be next to impossible to continue
to draw from them a revenue by taxation;—that
if we intended conciliation
with America, some of our measures were
too rough; and if we intended its subjection,
they were too gentle. He concluded
by saying, Enfin, Messieurs, je
ne comprends pas ces choses là; je n’ai
point de colonie:—j’espère que vous vous
tirerez bien d’affaire, mais elle me parôit
un peu épineuse.—— Having said
this, he walked into the Princess’s apartment,
to lead her to the playhouse, while
we joined the company already assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
there.—The tragedy of Mahomet was performed,
which, in my opinion, is the finest
of all Voltaire’s dramatic pieces, and that
in which Le Kain appears to the greatest
advantage.</p>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>You express such an earnest desire to
be made acquainted with every thing
which regards the King of Prussia, that I
am in danger of lengthening my descriptions
with a tedious minuteness. Yet I
will risk it, rather than give you reason to
complain that I have not gratified your curiosity
as fully as is in my power.</p>

<p>Do not imagine, however, that I presume
to draw a complete portrait of this
monarch. That must be the work of much
abler painters, who have seen him in a
more familiar manner, and whose colours
can give an expression worthy of the original.
I shall only attempt to give a
faithful sketch of such features as I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
able to seize during the transient views I
myself had, or which I have learnt from
those who have passed with him many of
the hours which he dedicates to free conversation,
and the pleasures of the table.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia is below the middle
size, well made, and remarkably active
for his time of life. He has become hardy
by exercise and a laborious life; for his
constitution originally seems to have been
none of the strongest. His look announces
spirit and penetration. He has fine blue
eyes; and, in my opinion, his countenance
upon the whole is agreeable. Some who
have seen him are of a different opinion.
All who judge from his portraits only, must
be so; for although I have seen many
which have a little resemblance of him,
and some which have a great deal, yet
none of them do him justice. His features
acquire a wonderful degree of animation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
while he converses.—This is entirely lost
upon canvas.</p>

<p>He stoops considerably, and inclines his
head almost constantly to one side.</p>

<p>His tone of voice is the cleared and most
agreeable in conversation I ever heard.</p>

<p>He speaks a great deal; yet those who
hear him, regret that he does not speak a
great deal more. His observations are always
lively, very often just, and few men
possess the talent of repartee in greater perfection.</p>

<p>He hardly ever varies his dress, which
consists of a blue coat, lined and faced with
red, and a yellow waistcoat and breeches.
He always wears boots, with hussar tops,
which fall in wrinkles about his ancles, and
are oftener of a dark brown than a black
colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>His hat would be thought extravagantly
large in England, though it is of the size
commonly used by the Prussian officers of
cavalry. He generally wears one of the
large side corners over his forehead and
eyes, and the front cock at one side.</p>

<p>He wears his hair cued behind, and
dressed with a single buckle on each side.
From their being very carelessly put up
and unequally powdered, we may naturally
conclude, that the friseur has been
greatly hurried in the execution of his
office.</p>

<p>He uses a very large gold snuff-box, the
lid ornamented with diamonds, and takes
an immoderate quantity of Spanish snuff,
the marks of which very often appear on
his waistcoat and breeches. These are also
liable to be soiled by the paws of two or
three Italian greyhounds, which he often
caresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>He dresses as soon as he gets up in the
morning. This takes up but a few minutes,
and serves for the whole day.—You
have often heard that the King of Prussia’s
hours, from four or five in the morning,
till ten at night, are all dedicated methodically
to particular occupations, either of
business or amusement. This is certainly
true, and the arrangement has not
sustained such an interruption for many
years, as since the present company came
to Potsdam.</p>

<p>Some who pretend to more than common
penetration assert, that at present
they can perceive marks of uneasiness in
his countenance, and seem convinced, that
there will not be such another company
at Sans-Souci during this reign.</p>

<p>All business with the King is transacted
by letters. Every petition or proposal
must be made in this form, which is adhered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to so invariably, as I have been assured,
that if any of his Generals wished to
promote a cadet to the rank of an ensign,
he would not venture to make his proposal
in any other manner, even though he had
daily opportunities of conversing with his
Majesty.</p>

<p>The meanest of his subjects may apply
to him in writing, and are sure of an
answer. His first business every morning
is the perusing the papers addressed to him.
A single word wrote with his pencil in
the margin, indicates the answer to be
given, which is afterwards made out in
form by his secretaries.—This method affords
the King time to deliberate on the
justice and propriety of every demand, and
prevents the possibility of his being surprised
into a promise, which it might be
inconvenient to perform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>He sits down to dinner precisely at noon.
Of late he allows more time to this repast
than formerly. It is generally after three
before he leaves the company. Eight or
nine of his officers are commonly invited to
dine with him. Since our coming to Potsdam,
Count Nesselrode, and the Abbé
Bastiani, two men of letters, were the only
company, besides the officers, who dined
with the King, while he lived in his usual
way at the Old Palace of Sans-Souci; and
those two were then of his party almost
every day. The Count has now left this
Court; the Abbé has an apartment in the
Palace. He is an Italian by birth, a man
of wit, and an excellent companion.</p>

<p>At table, the King likes that every person
should appear to be on a footing, and
that the conversation should be carried on
with perfect freedom. The thing, by the
way, is impossible. That confidential unrestrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
flow of the heart, which takes
place in a society of equals, is a pleasure
which a despotic Prince can never taste.
However, his Majesty desires that it may
be so, and they make the best of it they
can.</p>

<p>At one of these meetings, when the
King was in a gay humour, he said to Bastiani,—When
you shall obtain the tiara,
which your exemplary piety must one day
procure you, how will you receive me
when I arrive at Rome to pay my duty to
your Holiness?—I will immediately give
orders, replied the Abbé, with great readiness,
Qu’on fasse entrer l’aigle noir,—qu’il
me couvre de ses ailes, mais—qu’il m’épargne
de son bec.</p>

<p>Nobody says more lively things in conversation
than the King himself. Many of
his bons mots are repeated here, I shall
only mention one, which is at once an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
instance of his wit, and greatness of mind,
in rendering justice to the merit of a man
who has caused him more vexation than
perhaps any other person alive.—When
the King of Prussia had a personal meeting
some years since with the Emperor; they
always dined together, a certain number of
their principal officers being with them.
One day, General Laudohn was going to
place himself at the bottom of the table, when
the King, who was at the head, called to
him, Venez, je vous en prie, Monsieur
Laudohn, placez vous ici. J’aime infiniment
mieux vous avoir de mon cotè que
vis-à-vis.</p>

<p>Though all the cordiality of friendship,
and the full charms of unreserved society,
cannot exist where the fortune of every
other individual depends on the will of one
of the company; yet the King endeavours
to put every one as much at his ease as
the nature of the case will admit, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
have heard of his bearing some very severe
retorts with perfect good humour. He has
too much wit himself, and is too fond of it
in others, to repel its attacks with any
other weapons than those which it furnishes.
None but the most absurd of
dunces could attempt to rally, without being
able to allow of raillery; and only the
meanest of souls would think of revenging
the liberties taken with a companion by the
power of a King.</p>

<p>A very striking instance of the freedom
which may be used with him occurred a
little before the late reviews, and what
makes it more remarkable, it happened, not
during the gaiety of the table, but on the
very scene of military strictness.</p>

<p>Two regiments were in the field. That
of General —— was one of them. This
officer is fond of company, and passes more
of his time in the society of strangers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
with the foreign ministers, than most others
in the Prussian service.—Something, it is
probable, had chagrined the King that
morning. While the regiment advanced
in a line, he said to the General, who stood
near him, Votre regiment n’est pas aligné,
Monsieur ——, et ce n’est pas surprenant,
vous jouez tant aux cartes. The General
called out instantly with a loud voice to
the regiment, Alte! and they immediately
stopped: then, turning to the King, he said,
Il n’est pas question, Sire, de mes cartes—Mais,
ayez la bonté de regarder si ce regiment
n’est pas aligné.—The regiment was
in a very straight line, and the King moved
away without speaking, and seemingly
displeased, not with the General, but with
himself.—This manly officer never had reason
afterwards to believe that the King had
taken his freedom amiss.</p>

<p>I have already said, that it is absolutely
impossible for any man to enjoy an office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in the King of Prussia’s service without performing
the duty of it. He is himself
active and assiduous, and he makes it a
point that all his ministers and servants
shall be so too. But to those who know
their business, and perform it exactly, he is
an easy and equitable master.</p>

<p>A gentleman, who has been many years
about his person, and is now one of his aid-de-camps,
assured me of this:—The King
understands what ought to be done: and
his servants are never exposed to the ridiculous
or contradictory orders of ignorance,
or the mortifications of caprice.</p>

<p>His favourites, of whatever kind, never
were able to acquire influence over him in
any thing regarding business. Nobody
ever knew better how to discriminate the
merit of those who serve him in the important
departments of state, from theirs
who contribute to his amusement. A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
who performs the duty of his office with
alertness and fidelity, has nothing to apprehend
from the King’s being fond of the
company and conversion of his enemy.
Let the one be regaled at the King’s table
every day, while the other never receives a
single invitation; yet the real merit of both
is known:—and if his adversary should ever
try to turn the King’s favour to the purposes
of private hatred or malice, the attempt
will be repelled with disdain, and the evil
he intended to another, will fall on himself.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXVII">LETTER LXXVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>On the days when there is no public
court at Sans-Souci, we generally dine
with Lord Marechal, who is always happy
to see the D—— of H——, and is of great
service to all British subjects while they
remain here or at Berlin. Exclusive of
other reasons he may have for esteeming
the Duke, his Lordship evidently displays
a kind of partiality for his Grace, as the
first man in point of rank belonging to his
country. This appears in a thousand instances;
for with very liberal sentiments,
and a most benevolent heart, this venerable
nobleman still retains a few Caledonian
prejudices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>He asked one day of the D——, If he
reckoned himself a Scotchman? Most
certainly I do, replied his Grace. By so
doing you lie under a mistake, said my
Lord; for I can assure you, and I am convinced
the best lawyers in England will
do the same, that you have a much juster
claim to all the privileges belonging to
your English title of B——n, though some
of them, I fear, are still disputed.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped, said the D——, that
the House of Peers will not always refuse
to do my family justice; on a thorough
examination of the case, I still flatter myself
they will grant me those privileges,
which have been, for no valid reasons,
refused my ancestors. But in the mean
time, why will your Lordship, more cruel
than the Peers, deny my birth-right as a
Scotchman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Because your birth gives you no such
right, replied the Earl; for you in reality
are but a North Briton:—unless your Grace
can prove that you were born before
the Union. But, continued he, with an
air of triumph, I am a real Scotchman:—adding
a little after, with
a sigh, and in a plaintive accent—and
almost the only one in the world—All
the Scots of my acquaintance are now
dead.</p>

<p>The good old Earl is infinitely fond of
talking of his country, and of the days of
former years. When I make any enquiry
about the King of Prussia, or concerning
Spain or Italy, in which countries he resided
so long, he answers with a kind of
complaisant brevity, and immediately turns
the discourse back to Scotland, to which
his heart seems wonderfully attached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>In the time of dinner, one of his servants,
a stout highlander, generally entertains
the company by playing on the bagpipe.
I have observed, that these North
Britons (to abide by Lord Marechal’s distinction)
who are the most zealous for
the interest and honour of their country,
and who value themselves on being born
north of the Tweed, are particularly, if
not exclusively, fond of this instrument.
You will, at least, allow that your gallant
friend, Lord E——n, is no exception to
this observation; and perhaps you will admit,
that it requires a considerable degree
of patriotism, or <i>amor Caledoniæ</i> to have
a great relish for the melody of a bagpipe.</p>

<p>I called on Lord Marechal one afternoon,
just as the King had left him; for
the monarch, without any form or previous
notice, sometimes walks through the
garden, and pays a short visit to his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
friend, to whom he has an unalterable
attachment, both from personal regard,
and on account of the high estimation in
which he holds the memory of his brother
Marechal Keith.</p>

<p>Another day I was with the Earl, when
the Princesses of Prussia and Hesse, with
Prince Frederic of Brunswic, all entered
and demanded coffee, which my
Lord immediately ordered, with the addition
of a couple of melons; telling the
Princesses, he knew they would not stay
long enough with a man of eighty, to
give time for preparing a better repast.—Thus
favoured by the monarch and the
Princes, you will not doubt that the old
Earl’s friendship is cultivated by the rest of
the court.</p>

<p>The Hereditary Prince of Prussia lives
in a small house in the town of Potsdam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
His appointments do not admit of that
degree of magnificence, which might be
expected in the Heir of the crown;—but
he displays a spirit of hospitality far
more obliging than magnificence; and
doubly meritorious, considering the very
moderate revenue allowed him. We generally
sup there two or three times a
week.</p>

<p>This Prince is not often of the King’s
parties, nor is it imagined that he enjoys
a great share of his uncle’s favour. In
what degree he possesses the talents of a
general is not known, as he was too young
to have any command during the late
war. But he certainly has a very just understanding,
which has been improved by
study. He has taken some pains to acquire
the English language, to which he
was induced by an admiration of several
English authors, whose works he had read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
in French and German. He is now able
to read English prose with tolerable facility,
and has been of late studying Shakespear,
having actually read two or three
of his plays.</p>

<p>I took the liberty to observe, that as
Shakespear’s genius had traced every labyrinth,
and penetrated into every recess
of the human heart, his sentiments could
not fail to please his Royal Highness; but,
as his language was uncommonly bold and
figurative, and full of allusions to national
customs, and the manners of our island
two centuries ago, the English themselves,
who had not made a particular study of his
works, did not always comprehend their
full energy. I added, that to transfuse the
soul of Shakespear into a translation, was
impossible; and to taste all his beauties in
the original, required such a knowledge
of the English manners and language as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
few foreigners, even after a long residence
in the capital, could attain.</p>

<p>The Prince said, he was aware of all
this; yet he was determined to struggle
hard for some acquaintance with an author
so much admired by the English nation;
that though he should never be able
to taste all his excellencies, he was convinced
he should understand enough to recompence
him for his trouble; that he had
already studied some detached parts, which
he thought superior to any thing he had
ever met with in the works of any other Poet.
His Royal Highness attends to military
business with as much assiduity as most
officers of the same rank in the army; for
in the Prussian service, no degree of eminence
in the article of birth can excuse a
remission in the duties of that profession.
He is much esteemed by the army, and
considered as an exceeding good officer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
To the frankness of a soldier he joins the
integrity of a German, and is beloved by
the public in general, on account of his
good-nature, affability, and humane turn
of mind.</p>

<p class="right">Potsdam.</p>

<p>I am afraid you will think the anecdotes
and conversation which I sometimes
send you are rather tedious. Your curiosity
about certain characters has led me into
this practice; for I choose to give you opportunities
of forming an opinion of your
own, rather than to trouble you with mine.
My opinion might very probably be erroneous;
the accounts I give of what I have
seen or heard are always true. And, notwithstanding
that the actions and conversations
I relate, may be apparently of small
importance, still as the persons in some
measure describe themselves, an understanding
like yours will be able from thence
to draw juster ideas of character than I
could have given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>In a former letter I mentioned the great
difficulty of deserting from a Prussian garrison,
and of what importance it is thought
to prevent it. An incident which happened
a few days since, will give you a stronger
idea of this than any general account.</p>

<p>Two soldiers of the Prince of Prussia’s
regiment got over the walls in the night-time,
with an intention to desert; but unluckily
for them, this town stands on a
peninsula formed by the river, and the
neck of land is guarded in such a manner
that it is almost impossible to pass that way
without permission. These men could not
swim, and they durst not present themselves
at any of the ferries, because the
boatmen are forbid, under the severest
penalties, to connive at the escape of any
deserters, and strictly ordered to assist in
apprehending them. A reward is also offered,
as a greater inducement to this piece
of service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>All these circumstances being known in
the garrison, it was imagined that, as none
of the peasants would in all probability venture
to harbour them, they were still skulking
in the fields among the standing corn.
On this supposition, parties of men were
employed for three days successively in traversing
the fields, and beating the bushes,
as if they had been in chace of a hare. Great
numbers of the officers of this regiment,
some of the highest rank, rode about for
three or four hours every day, all employed
in the same manner. But not finding
the men, they were at last convinced that
they had by some means or other got out
of the peninsula, and all further search was
given up as unnecessary.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day, these
two unfortunate men came and surrendered
to the guard at one of the gates. Finding
it impracticable to effect their escape,
and not daring to enter a house, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at length compelled by hunger and fatigue
to deliver themselves up.</p>

<p>Before I close this letter, I will give you
an account of an adventure of an affecting
nature, which happened in the King’s
family, at the time when all these researches
were made for the two deserters.</p>

<p>The King’s principal valet-de chambre
was a man considerably respected. Having
constant opportunities of being about the
King’s person, and having enjoyed his approbation
for several years, people of the
first rank paid him some degree of attention.
He was liked by his acquaintances,
as I have been told, on account of his personal
qualities, and had accumulated a little
fortune by the perquisites of his office. He
had built a house near that of my Lord
Marechal, and kept a coach for the use of
his mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this man’s misfortune to disoblige
the King, probably by some neglect of
duty; or it might possibly be something
worse:—I never could hear exactly how
this had happened:—But while the Princesses
were at the New Palace, the King
had blamed him in very sharp terms; and
not being satisfied with the excuses the
man made, he told him, that, as soon as
the company was gone, he should be taken
care of.</p>

<p>When the Princesses went to Berlin, his
Majesty returned to his old palace at Sans-Souci;
and the day after, he sent for an
officer of his guards, and ordered him to
conduct this man to Potsdam, and place
him in the quality of a drummer in the
first regiment of foot-guards.</p>

<p>The poor man endeavoured to pacify
his master by prayers and entreaties, but
without success.—He then said to the officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that there were some things in his
room which he wished to put in order before
he went, and desired that he might be
allowed a little time for that purpose. The
officer readily assented, and as soon as this
desperate man had entered his own apartment,
he seized a pistol, which he had
prepared from the time the King had
threatened him, and immediately shot himself
through the head. The report of the
pistol alarmed the King and the officer.—They
both went into the room, and found
the poor creature expiring.</p>

<p>Though the King certainly had no idea
that his valet would shoot himself; and
though, it is most probable, he would not
have allowed him to remain long in the
situation to which, in a fit of resentment,
he had condemned him;—yet there is
something exceedingly harsh in dashing a
man at once from a situation of ease and
respect, into a sphere of life so very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
different.—Such an order was more becoming
the fury of an intemperate despot, than the
dignity of so great and so wise a monarch
as the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>I conversed with a person who had been
at Sans-Souci immediately after this melancholy
event.—He said the King seemed
to be very much affected.—If he felt it as
he ought, he was an object of compassion;
if he did not, he was still more so, for nothing
can be a greater misfortune to a man
than to want humanity.</p>

<p>I believe I neglected to mention in any of
my letters from Berlin, that when I
visited the manufactory of porcelain, I was
so much struck with the beauty of some
of it, that I ordered a small box for you.
But as I take it to be a matter of indifference,
whether you sip your tea out of the
china you have already, or this, you may
send it as a present to the female you love

should not go straight from you to Miss

it. The factor at Hamburgh will give you
notice when he ships it off.</p>

<p>I did not imagine that this manufactory
had arrived at such a degree of perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
as it has in several places in Germany,
particularly at Brunswic and Berlin. The
parcel I have ordered for you, is thought
equal to the finest made at Dresden.</p>

<p>The day we left Potsdam we dined with
good Lord Marechal, who took leave of
the D——, with an emotion which at
once marked his regard for his G——, and
his fears that he should never see him
again.</p>

<p>If I were strongly in a humour for description,
our journey through the most
beautiful and most fertile part of Germany,
would afford me a fair opportunity. I not
only could ring over the whole chimes of
woods, meadows, rivers, and mountains,
rich crops of grain, flax, tobacco, and hops;
I might animate the landscapes with a
copious breed of horses, black cattle, sheep,
wild boars, and venison, and vary the description
with the marble, precious stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and mines of lead, copper, iron, and silver,
which Saxony contains within its bowels.
I might expatiate on the fine china ware,
and fine women, that abound in this country,
formed of the finest clay in Germany,
et très joliment travaillées;—but I am long
since tired of description, and therefore beg
leave to convey you at once from Potsdam
to Dresden.</p>

<p>Having been presented to the Elector
and Electress by Mr. Osborn, the British
minister here, we had the honour of dining
with them the same day. The Electress is
young, tall, well-made, and lively.—We
were afterwards presented to the Electress
Dowager, and to the Princess Elizabeth,
the Elector’s aunt, to the Princess, his
sister, and to his three brothers, the eldest
of whom has lost the use of his legs, and
is moved about the room in a chair with
wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The court was numerous and splendid.
In the evening there was card-playing for
about two hours. The D—— of H—— was
of the Electress’s party, while I played
two rubbers at whist with one of the
Princesses, against the Electress Dowager
and the Princess Elizabeth.—I have never
seen deep gaming at any of the German
courts.—What has approached nearest to it,
has been at masquerades, or where the
Sovereign was not present.</p>

<p>Dresden, though not one of the largest,
is certainly one of the most agreeable cities
in Germany, whether we consider its situation,
the magnificence of its palaces, or
the beauty and conveniency of the houses
and streets. This city is built on both sides
of the Elbe, which is of a considerable
breadth here. The magnificent and commodious
manner in which the two opposite
parts of the town are joined, adds greatly
to its beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an equestrian statue of King
Augustus, in a kind of open place or square,
between the old city and the new. The
workmanship is but indifferent; however,
I was desired by our Cicerone to admire
this very much, because—it was made
by a common smith. I begged to be excused,
telling him that I could not admire
it, had it been made by Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>Few Princes in Europe are so magnificently
lodged as the Elector of Saxony.
The Palace and Museum have been often
described.—The last was begun by the
Elector Augustus, and still retains the name
of the Green Room, though it now consists
of several apartments, all painted green, in
imitation of the first. I will not enumerate
the prodigious number of curiosities,
natural and artificial, to be seen there. Some
of the last are curious, only because they
are invisible to the human eye. Of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
number, is a cherry stone, upon which, by
the help of a microscope, above a hundred
faces may be distinguished. Undoubtedly
these little mechanical whims display the
labour, perseverance, and minute attention
of the workman; but I cannot think they
are proofs of the wisdom of those who
could employ artists to so little purpose.
Let the astonishing minutiæ of nature be
admired through microscopes; but surely
nothing is a proper work for the hands of
man, which cannot be seen by the unaided
human eye.</p>

<p>A work of the jeweller Dinglinger,
which represents the celebration of the
Mogul’s birth-day, is much admired. The
Mogul sitting on his throne, his grandees
and guards, with a great many elephants,
are all exhibited upon a table about an ell
square. This work employed Dinglinger,
and some assistants, above ten years. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
not you think this was leaving so ingenious
an artist a little too long in the Mogul’s
service?</p>

<p>A simple list of every thing valuable
and curious in this Museum, would exceed
the bounds of one of my longest letters;
I shall therefore pass them all over in
silence, except the story of the prophet
Jonah, which it would be impious to omit.
The ship, the whale, the prophet, and
the sea-shore, are all represented in pearl;
but the sea and rocks are in a different kind
of stone, though, in my opinion, there
was no occasion to vary the materials;
for surely there is as great a difference between
a prophet and a whale, as between
a whale and a rock. So that if the first
two could be represented with the same
materials, I do not think it was worth
while to change the composition for the
third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The gallery of pictures is highly esteemed.
To enumerate the particular merits
of each, would fill many volumes, and requires
a far greater knowledge of painting
than I can pretend to. The most valuable
pieces are by Corregio and Rubens. There
are three or four by the former, and of his
most capital works; and a very considerable
number by the latter. The strength and
expression of this great artist’s pencil, the
natural glow of his colouring, and the fertility
of his fancy deserve the highest encomiums.
Yet one cannot help regretting,
that he had so violent a passion for fat
women. That kind of nature which he
had seen early in life in his own country,
had laid such hold of his imagination, that
it could not be eradicated by all the elegant
models he afterwards studied in
Italy. Some of his female figures in
this gallery are so much of the Dutch
make, and so fat, that it is rather oppressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to look at them in this very hot
weather.</p>

<p>In the Museum, within the Palace, there
is a most complete collection of prints, from
the commencement of the art of engraving
till the present time.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXX">LETTER LXXX.</h2>

<p class="right">Dresden.</p>

<p>Nothing seems clearer to me, than
that a fortified town should have no
palaces within it, and no suburbs without.
As the city of Dresden has both, it would
have been well for the inhabitants, during
the last war, that the town had been entirely
without fortifications. In the year
1756, when the King of Prussia thought
it expedient to invade Saxony, he made
himself master of this city, and kept
peaceable possession of it till 1758, when
Marechal Daun, after the battle of Hochkirchen,
threatened to besiege it. The
Prussian General Schmettau began his defence
by burning part of the suburbs.
The Saxons and Austrians exclaimed at
this measure, and Daun threatened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
make the governor answerable, in his own
person, for such desperate proceedings.
Count Schmettau was totally regardless of
their exclamations and threats, and seemed
attentive only to the orders of the King
his master. He gave Marechal Daun to
understand, that the remaining suburbs
would share the fate of those already destroyed,
if he persisted in attacking the
town. The King appearing soon after, the
Austrians retreated into Bohemia.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Dresden, and all Saxony,
were now in a very dismal situation,
and found their hardships increase in proportion
to the success of their friends
and allies; for whatever exactions were
raised in the King of Prussia’s dominions
by the Austrians and Russians, the like
were imposed by way of retaliation on the
miserable Saxons. A people must be in a
deplorable state indeed, when the success of
their enemies is the most fortunate thing
which can befal them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1759, after the dreadful battle of
Cunersdorf, near Frankfort on the Oder,
the King of Prussia being necessitated to
repair the slaughter of that day, withdrew
the Prussian garrison from Dresden, which
then fell into the hands of the Imperialists.
But the calamities of this city did not end
here; for his Prussian Majesty having deceived
Marechal Daun by a very masterly
feint, while he seemed to bend his course
for Silesia, he wheeled suddenly about,
and threatened Dresden, which Marechal
Daun had abandoned, in the full conviction,
that the King had marched to the
relief of Schweidnitz. While the Austrians
hurried on by forced marches into Silesia,
the King attacked Dresden, which
was resolutely defended by General Macquire.</p>

<p>Every possible effort was made to reduce
this city before Count Daun should return
to its relief;—and the wretched citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
were exposed to a continued cannonade and
bombardment. This perhaps was justifiable
by the laws of war, as long as there
were hopes that the town might be
brought to surrender by such means.—But
the enemies of his Prussian Majesty
assert, that the bombardment was continued,
and churches, fine buildings, and
whole streets laid in ashes, even after
Marechal Daun’s return; and when these
vindictive proceedings could only tend to
the ruin and destruction of private people,
without contributing in the smallest degree
to the reducing the town, or being of
any use to the public cause.</p>

<p>Many of these houses still lie in rubbish;
but the inhabitants are gradually
rebuilding, and probably all the ruined
streets will be repaired before a new war
breaks out in Germany. While they rebuild
the houses, I cannot help thinking
it would be fortunate for the proprietors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
that they were allowed to destroy the fortifications,
which perhaps might be placed
with more advantage around some towns
on the frontiers.</p>

<p>The curious manufactory of porcelain
suffered considerably by the Prussian bombardment.
The Elector has a complete
collection of the finest pieces, from the
first attempts made here in this elegant
work, to the latest improvements. This,
independent of the beauty of many of the
pieces, is a matter of real curiosity, as
it marks the progress of ingenuity and invention.</p>

<p>Our morning-walk is in the gardens of
the late Count Bruhl, situated on the high
banks of the Elbe. Nothing can be imagined
more delightful than the view from
a lofty terrace in these gardens. The
Count’s magnificent house is now stript
of many of its greatest ornaments. The
fine collection of paintings has been sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to the Empress of Russia for 150,000 rix-dollars.
The library, which is in the garden,
is two hundred and twenty feet long.
I am not certain, whether it was absolutely
necessary to have so large a room
for containing this nobleman’s books; but
it must have required one of that size at
least for his wardrobe, if the account that
is given of it be just. They tell us, that
the Count had at least three hundred different
suits of clothes; each of these had
a duplicate, as he always shifted his clothes
after dinner, and did not choose that his
dress should appear different in the afternoon
from what it had been in the morning.
A painting of each suit, with the
particular cane and snuff-box belonging to
it, was very accurately drawn in a large
book, which was presented to his Excellency
every morning by his Valet de Chambre,
that he might fix upon the dress in
which he wished to appear for the day.
This minister was accused of having accumulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
a great fortune. The reverse of
this, however, is true. His house and
gardens belong now to the Elector.</p>

<p>The Saxon troops make a very fine appearance.
The men in general are handsome
and well made. Neither they nor
their officers are so very upright and stiff
in their manners, as the Prussians. Having
been so long accustomed to these last,
this difference struck me very strongly at
first sight. The uniform of the guards is
red and yellow; that of the marching regiments
white. The soldiers, during the
summer, wear only waistcoats, even when
they mount guard; and always appear
extremely neat and clean. The serjeants,
besides their other arms, have a large pistol.
This is so commodiously fastened to the
left side, that it gives no trouble. The
band of music belonging to the Saxon
guards is the most complete and the finest
I ever saw.</p>

<p>I do not expect to receive any accounts
from you till we arrive at Vienna; but I
shall probably write again from Prague,
for which place we intend to set out to-morrow.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXXI">LETTER LXXXI.</h2>

<p class="right">Prague.</p>

<p>Bohemia, though by no means so
fertile, or so fine a country as Saxony,
does not deserve the bad character which
some travellers have given it. I thought
many places very beautiful, and varied with
the most agreeable rural objects.</p>

<p>Prague, the capital of Bohemia, stands
in a hollow, surrounded on all sides with
hills. Those nearest the town, and which
command it, are comprehended within the
fortifications. It is a very large town, retaining
some marks of former splendor, but
many more evident symptoms of present
decay—Symptoms which naturally attend
those places which once have been the residence
of royalty, and are so no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>All the houses, with any appearance of
magnificence, are old, and it is not probable,
that any new ones will be built in
that style: for the Bohemian nobility, who
are in circumstances to bear such an expence,
live at Vienna, and the trade and
manufactures of this town are not sufficient
to enable any of the mercantile people to
build fine houses.</p>

<p>In whatever degree this city may have
dwindled in wealth and magnificence, the
piety of the inhabitants certainly flourishes
as much as ever. I do not recollect to
have seen so many glaring marks of devotion
in any place. The corners of the
streets, bridges, and public buildings, are
all ornamented with crucifixes, images of
the Virgin of all sizes and complexions,
and statues of Saints of every country, condition,
age, and sex. People are to be
seen on their knees before these statues in
every part of this city, but particularly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the large bridge over the Moldaw, where
there is the greatest concourse of passengers.
This bridge is so profusely adorned
with the statues of Saints, that crossing over
it, you have a row of them on each side,
like two ranks of musketeers.</p>

<p>Travellers, especially such as arrive directly
from Berlin, must be astonished at
the people’s devotion in this city, in a particular
manner at the vehemence with
which it is expressed by those who exhibit
before the saints upon the bridge.</p>

<p>Not contented with kneeling, I saw some
prostrate themselves on their faces, kissing
the earth; and others, who offered their
petitions to these saints with such earnestness
and fervour, that, if their hearts had
not been of stone, they must have paid
more attention to the petitioners than they
seemed to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one saint who has more votaries
than all the rest put together—Saint Nepomuc,
I think they call him:—As my
acquaintance with saints is not extensive, I
never heard of him till I came hither,
but his reputation is very great in this
town. This saint, it seems, was ordered
by some cruel tyrant, to be thrown over a
bridge, and his neck was broke by the fall,
and he is supposed to retain a particular
affection for bridges ever since; an effect
something different from what was to
have been expected from the cause; however,
the people here are persuaded, that so
it happened to Saint Nepomuc; and to put
the fact beyond controversy, he is at this
moment the tutelar saint of bridges;—almost
all those in Bohemia are dedicated
to him. He has also the reputation of excelling
every saint in heaven in the cure
of barrenness in women.—How his character
for this was established, I did not
enquire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a melancholy reflection, that the
wealthy are more careless about religious
duties than the indigent, and that poverty
and piety are so often linked together. I
often observed, when we stopped at any
town or village, which had symptoms of
great poverty, that the inhabitants seemed
also unusually devout.</p>

<p>It would appear, that hope is a more
powerful sentiment in the human breast
than gratitude, since those who ought to
feel the greatest thankfulness to Heaven
display the least.</p>

<p>We found an acquaintance at Prague
when we least expected it; for as the D——
of H—— and I stood talking in the streets,
a priest, who belongs to a seminary of
learning in this town, overheard us; upon
which he stopped, and after looking at
us very earnestly for some time, he at
length came up, and addressed us in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
words:—I do assure you now, I am an
Irishman too. This easy kind of introduction
soon produced a degree of intimacy;
I asked how he knew so readily that we
were Irish? Am I not after hearing you
speak English, my dear? replied the honest
priest, for he really was a very honest obliging
fellow, and the most useful and entertaining
Cicerone we could have had at
Prague.</p>

<p>After having visited the royal apartments,
they shewed us the window in the
secretary of state’s office, from whence
three noblemen were thrown in the year
1618. This was rather a violent mode of
turning out the people in power; but it is
probable the party in opposition had tried
gentler means in vain.</p>

<p>As one great use of history is to furnish
lessons and examples, by which posterity
in all ages may profit, I do not think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
would be amiss to remind your friends in
administration of this adventure, that they
may move off quietly before their opponents
take desperate measures. For it
has been observed, that the enemies of
tottering statesmen are much more active
than their friends, who, when things
come to the last push, are apt to stand
aloof,</p>

<p class="noindent">In case however a similar outrage should be
threatened in England, it is to be hoped
that Apollo (as he was wont of old
when any of his friends were in danger)
will interpose with a cloud, and save
the Minister; for, in the present scarcity
of wit and good humour, it would be a
thousand pities to lose a man so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
distinguished for both, at one desperate
throw.</p>

<p>We walked over the heights from which
the Prussians attempted to carry the town,
immediately after the defeat of Prince
Charles of Lorraine and Count Brown.
The bombardment of this town was a
more defensible measure than that of Dresden;
for while the army within were
under the dejection natural after the loss
of a battle, and unprepared for a siege,
it might be supposed, that the confusion
and terror produced by the bombardment,
joined to the vast consumption of provisions
by such a numerous garrison, would
induce the besieged to surrender. But although
the King’s humanity has not been
called in question for his conduct here,
I have heard many military men censure
him for want of prudence, particularly
on account of his desperate attempt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Kolin, when, leaving the half of his army
to continue the blockade of Prague, he
marched with little more than thirty thousand
men, and attacked an army of double
that number, strongly situated, and commanded
by one of the ablest generals of
the age.</p>

<p>After all, it is more than probable, that
the King had very good reasons for his
conduct. But as the attempt was unsuccessful,
and as the sad reverse of the Prussian
affairs may be dated from that epoch, the
voice of censure has been very loud in
blaming an action, which would have been
exalted to the skies had it been crowned
with success. If Hannibal had by any accident
been defeated at Cannæ, it is very
possible, that historians would have found
out many reasons why he should not have
fought that battle, and would have endeavoured
to prove, that his former victories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
had been gained by chance, and
that he was a mere ignoramus in the art
of war.</p>

<p>Adieu, my good friend; I wish you good
luck in all your undertakings, that you may
continue to be reckoned by the world, a
man of prudence.</p>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>On arriving at Vienna, the postillions
drive directly to the Custom-house,
where the baggage undergoes a very severe
scrutiny, which neither fair words nor
money can mitigate. As nothing contraband
was found among our baggage, it
was all carried directly to our lodgings,
except our books, which were retained to
be examined at leisure, and were not restored
to us till some time after. The Empress
has given strict orders, that no books
of impiety, lewdness, or immorality, shall
be allowed to enter her dominions, or be
circulated among her subject; and Mahomet
himself dares as soon appear publicly at
Vienna as any one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, Sir Robert Keith
is lately gone to England, and is not expected
back for several months. We have reason
to regret the absence of so agreeable and so
worthy a man; but every advantage we
could have received from him as a minister,
has been supplied by his secretary, Mr.
Ernest, who has introduced us to the Count
Degenfelt, ambassador from the States-General.
This gentleman furnished us with
a list of the visits proper to be made, and
had the politeness to attend the D—— of
H—— on this grand tour.</p>

<p>The first day we waited on Prince Kaunitz,
we were invited to dine, and found a
very numerous company at his house, many
of whom, as I afterwards understood, had
been prepossessed in our favour, by the polite
and obliging letters which the Baron de
Swieten had written from Berlin.</p>

<p>Some of the principal families are at
their seats in the country, which we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
have more reason to regret, were it not
for the politeness and hospitality of the
Count and Countess Thune, at whose house,
or that of their sister the Countess Walstein,
there is an agreeable party every evening;
among whom is the Viscount de Laval,
brother to the Marquis, whom I had the
honour of knowing at Berlin. The Viscount
has been as far north as Petersburg,
and intends to make the tour of Italy before
he returns to France.</p>

<p>The city of Vienna, properly so called,
is not of very great extent; nor can it be
enlarged, being limited by a strong fortification.
This town is very populous: It is
thought to contain above seventy thousand
inhabitants. The streets in general are narrow,
and the houses built high. Some of
the public buildings and palaces are magnificent;
but they appear externally to no
great advantage, on account of the narrowness
of the streets. The chief are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Imperial Palace, the Library and Museum,
the palaces of the Princes Lichtenstein,
Eugene, and some others, which I know
you will excuse me from enumerating or
describing.</p>

<p>There is no great danger that Vienna
will ever again be subjected to the inconveniencies
of a siege. Yet, in case the
thing should happen, a measure has been
taken, which will prevent the necessity of
destroying the suburbs: No houses without
the walls are allowed to be built nearer
to the glacis than six hundred yards; so
that there is a circular field of six hundred
paces broad all around the town,
which, exclusive of the advantage above
mentioned, has a very beautiful and salutary
effect. Beyond the plain, the suburbs
are built.—They form a very extensive and
magnificent town of an irregularly circular
form, containing within its bosom a spacious
field, which has for its centre the
original town of Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>These magnificent suburbs, and the town
together, are said to contain above three
hundred thousand inhabitants; yet the
former are not near so populous, in proportion
to their size, as the town; because
many houses of the suburbs have extensive
gardens belonging to them, and many
families, who live during the winter within
the fortifications, pass the summer months
in the suburbs.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Breteuil, the French ambassador,
lives there at present. The Duke
and I dined at his house a few days ago.
This gentleman was attached to the Duc
de Choiseul, and had been appointed ambassador
to this court, in which character
he was about to set out from Paris, when
that minister was dismissed by the late King
of France; upon which M. de Breteuil,
instead of Vienna, was sent to Naples.
But since the new King’s accession, he has
been established at the court for which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
was originally intended. He is a man of
talents, and not calculated for a situation
in which talents have little or no room for
exertion.</p>

<p>About a week after our arrival at Vienna,
we had the honour of being presented to
the Emperor. The Count Degenfeldt accompanied
us to the palace between nine
and ten in the morning. After walking a
few minutes in an adjoining room, we were
conducted into that where the Emperor was
alone. His manner is affable, easy, and
gracefully plain.</p>

<p>The same forenoon we drove to Schonbrun,
a palace about a league from Vienna,
where the Empress resides at present. I had
no small curiosity to see the celebrated Maria
Theresa, whose fortunes have interested Europe
for so many years. Her magnanimity
in supporting the calamities to which the
early part of her life was exposed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
moderation with which she has borne prosperity,
have secured to her universal approbation.
She also was alone when we were
presented. She conversed for some time
with the D—— of H—— in an easy and
cheerful manner, and behaved to all with
an affable dignity. She now possesses but
small remains of that beauty for which she
was distinguished in her youth; but her
countenance indicates benevolence and
good-humour. I had often heard of the
scrupulous etiquette of the Imperial court,
but have found every thing directly opposite
to that account.</p>

<p>Prince Kaunitz having seen a young English
gentleman scarcely fourteen years of age,
whom the D—— of H—— patronizes, and
who has accompanied us on this tour, the
Prince desired that he also might be presented
to the Emperor and Empress, which
was accordingly done, and they both received
him in the most gracious manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
I mention this circumstance as a strong
proof how far they are superior at this
court to trifling punctilios, and how greatly
they have relaxed in ceremony since the
accession of the Lorrain family.</p>

<p>Two or three days after this, we were
presented, at a full court, to the two unmarried
Arch-Duchesses, their sister the
Princess Albert of Saxony, and the Princess
of Modena, who is married to the Emperor’s
brother. The last couple are lately
arrived from Milan on a visit to the Empress.</p>

<p>The Imperial family are uncommonly
well-looking, and have a very strong resemblance
to each other. They are all of a fair
complexion, with large blue eyes, and some
of them, particularly the Arch-duke, are distinguished
by the thick lip so long remarked
in the Austrian family. The beautiful
Queen of France is the handsomest of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
family, only because she is the youngest;
some people think that her sister the Princess
Albert has still the advantage.</p>

<p>One of the unmarried Arch-duchesses,
who formerly was thought the most beautiful,
has suffered considerably by the small-pox.—A
lady of the court told me, that, as
soon as this princess understood what her
disease was, she called for a looking-glass,
and with unaffected pleasantry took leave of
those features she had often heard praised,
and which she believed would be greatly
changed before she should see them again.
The diminution which the small-pox has
made in the beauty of this Princess, has not
in the smallest degree impaired her good-humour,
or the essential part of her character,
which by every account is perfectly
amiable.</p>

<p>When the King of Prussia saw his army
defeated at Cunersdorf, after he had written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
to the Queen that he was sure of victory;
or when any of those monarchs, of whom
history gives examples, were dashed from
their thrones to a state of dependence or captivity,
unquestionably it required great
strength of mind to bear such cruel reverses
of fortune; but perhaps it requires more in
a woman, whose beauty is admired by one
half of the human race, and envied by the
other, to support its loss with equanimity
in all the pride of youth.—If those veteran
beauties, who never had any thing but their
faces to give them importance, whom we
see still withering on the stalk, and repining
that they cannot retain the bloom of May
in the frost of December, had met with
such an accident, it would probably have
killed them at once, and saved them many
years of despised existence.</p>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>I never passed my time more agreeably
than since I came to Vienna. There is
not such a constant round of amusements as
to fill up a man’s time without any plan or
occupation of his own; and yet there is
enough to satisfy any mind not perfectly
vacant and dependent on external objects.—We
dine abroad two or three times a week.
We sometimes see a little play, but never
any deep gaming.—At the Countess
Thune’s, where I generally pass the evening,
there is no play of any kind.—The society
there literally form a conversazione.</p>

<p>I dare say, you will be at a loss to imagine
how a mixed company, sometimes pretty
numerous, can pass several hours every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
evening, merely in conversing, especially
when you are told that the conversation is
not always split into parties and tête-à-têtes;
but is very often general. You will suspect
there must be many melancholy pauses,
which, after a certain length, are prolonged,
from the reluctance of people to be the first
breakers of a very solemn silence; or you
may think that sometimes there will be so
many tongues moving at once, that nothing
can be heard distinctly; and you may possibly
figure to yourself the lady of the house
at other times endeavouring, by formal observations
on the weather, or politics, to
keep alive a conversation which is just expiring
in all the yawnings of death.</p>

<p>Nothing of this kind, however, happens.
The Countess has the art of entertaining a
company, and of making them entertain one
another, more than any person I ever knew.
With a great deal of wit, and a perfect
knowledge of the world, she possesses the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
most disinterested heart. She is the first to
discover the good qualities of her friends,
and the last who sees their foibles. One of
her greatest pleasures is to remove prejudices
from amongst her acquaintances, and to
promote friendships. She has an everlasting
flow of spirits, which she manages with such
address as to delight the gay, without displeasing
the dejected. I never knew any
body have such a number of friends, and so
much generous friendship to bestow on each:
She is daily making new ones, without allowing
her regard for the old to diminish.
She has formed a little system of happiness
at her own house, herself being the centre
of attraction and union. Nobody is under
the least necessity of remaining a moment in
this society after being tired.—They may
retire when they please.—No more notice is
taken of the entries or exits of any person
who has been once received, than of a fly’s
coming in or going out of the room.—There
is not the shadow of restraint.—If you go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
every night, you are always treated with
equal kindness; and if you stay away for a
month, you are received on your return with
the same cheerfulness as if you had been
there every evening.</p>

<p>The English who come to this place are
in a particular manner obliged to this family,
not only for the polite reception they
generally meet with, but also for the opportunities
this affords them of forming an acquaintance
with the principal people at
Vienna. And I imagine there is no city in
Europe where a young gentleman, after his
university education is finished, can pass a
year with so great advantage; because, if
properly recommended, he may mix, on an
easy footing, with people of rank, and have
opportunities of improving by the conversation
of sensible men and accomplished women.
In no capital could he see fewer examples,
or have fewer opportunities of deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
gaming, open profligacy, or gross debauchery.
He may learn to pass his time
agreeably, independent of a continued round
of amusements.—He may be gradually led
to enjoy rational conversation, and at length
acquire the blessed faculty of being satisfied
with moderate pleasures.</p>

<p>To the politeness of the Countess Thune,
and the recommendation of the Baron
Swieten, I am indebted for the agreeable
footing I am on with Prince Kaunitz, who
at present lives at Laxenberg, a pleasant
village about ten miles from Vienna,
where there is a small palace and very
extensive park, belonging to the Imperial
family.</p>

<p>Prince Kaunitz has lately built a house
there, and lives in a style equally hospitable
and magnificent. He is not to be seen before
dinner by any but people on business;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
but he always has a pretty large company
at dinner, and still greater numbers from
Vienna pass their evenings at Laxenberg;
not unfrequently the Emperor himself makes
one of the company. This minister has
enjoyed the favour of the Empress for many
years. He was her envoy at the treaty of
Aix la Chapelle in 1748, and has been of
her cabinet council ever since. At present
he is minister for all foreign affairs, and is
supposed to have greater influence with her
than any other person.</p>

<p>He is certainly a man of knowledge,
genius, and fidelity, and the affairs of this
court have prospered greatly under his management.
His friends are very much attached
to him, and he shews great discernment
in discovering, and employing men of
talents. He is the friend and patron of
Mons. de Swieten. It is supposed that he
advised and negociated the French alliance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
yet he has always had a strong partiality in
favour of the British nation.—He has some
singularities; but as they do not affect any
essential part of his character, they need not
be mentioned.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXXIV">LETTER LXXXIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of yours by the last post,
wherein you inform me that our acquaintance
C—— talks of setting out for
Vienna very soon. As nothing is so tiresome
as the company of one who is continually
tired of himself, I should be alarmed at your
information, were I not absolutely certain
that his stay here will be very short, come
when he will.</p>

<p>C—— called at my lodgings one morning
the summer before I had left London.—I
had remained in town merely because I had
no particular business elsewhere;—but he
assured me, that the town was a desert;—that
it was shameful to be seen in the
streets;—that all the world was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Brighthelmstone.—So I allowed him to conduct
me to that place, where we had remained
only a few days, when he told me, that none
of the people he cared for were there; and
as I had nothing particular to detain me, he
begged as a favour that I would accompany
him to Tunbridge.—We went accordingly,
and to my great satisfaction I there found
Mr. N——’s family. C—— remained pretty
quiet for about four days;—he yawned a
good deal on the fifth;—and on the sixth,
I thought he would have dislocated his
jaws. As he perceived I was pleased with the
place, and would take none of his hints
about leaving it, he at last pretended that he
had received a letter which made it absolutely
necessary for him to set out for London:—and
away he went.</p>

<p>I staid three weeks at Tunbridge.—On my
return to town, I understood that C—— had
taken a genteel furnished house for the summer,
in Yorkshire, where he had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
passed a week, having previously engaged a
female friend to go along with him.—He
left word in town, that he was not to be expected
till the meeting of parliament.
Though I never imagined that he would
remain quite so long, yet I was a little surprised
to see him enter my room two days
after I had received this account.—He told
me, he was quite disgusted with his house,
and more so with his companion:—and besides,
he had taken a violent fancy to go to
Paris, which you know, added he, is the
most delightful place in the world, especially
in summer; for the company never think
of rambling about the country like our
giddy fools in England, but remain together
in the capital as sensible people ought
to do.</p>

<p>He then proposed that we should pack
up a few things,—take post,—pass over,—and
spend a couple of months at Paris.
Finding I did not relish the proposal, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
wrote an apology to the lady in Yorkshire,
with an inclosed bank bill, and set out next
day by himself. I heard no more of him
for six weeks, but at the end of that time
happening to be at Bath, I saw my friend
C—— enter the pump-room.—’Egad, said he,
you were wise to stay at home:—Paris is become
the most insipid place on earth:—I
could not support it above ten days.—But
having heard a good deal of Holland, I even
took a jaunt to Amsterdam, which, between
friends, I found very little more amusing
than Paris; two days after my arrival,
finding an English ship just ready to sail, I
thought it would be a pity to let the opportunity
slip. So I ordered my trunk aboard.—We
had a disagreeable passage:—However,
I arrived safe a few days ago at Harwich.
After this sketch of poor C——’s turn
of mind, you see, I have no reason to fear
his remaining long with us, if he should
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Foreigners assert that the English have
more of this restless disposition than any
other people in Europe.</p>

<p>Il faut que votre ville de Londres soit un
triste séjour.—I asked the person who made
this remark to me, wherefore he thought so?—Parceque,
answered he, tous vos jeunes
gens que je vois en France s’ennuyent à la
mort.—But, said I, there are a great many
of your countrymen in London.—Assurément,
answered he, with polite insolence,
cela fait une différence.</p>

<p>Our climate is accused of producing this
ennuy. If I rightly remember, I formerly
hinted some reasons against this opinion,
and of late I begin to suspect that the excessive
wealth of certain individuals, and the
state of society in our capital, are the sole
causes of our having a greater share of that
malady among us than our neighbours.
The common people of England know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
nothing of it:—neither do the industrious
of any rank, whether their object be wealth,
knowledge, or fame. But in England there
is a greater number than in any other country,
of young men, who come to the possession
of great fortunes before they have
acquired any fixed and determined taste,
which may serve as a resource and occupation
through life.</p>

<p>When a youth has acquired a habit of application,
a thirst of knowledge, or of fame,
the most ample fortune which can fall to
him afterwards, cannot always destroy dispositions
and passions already formed—Particularly
if the passion be ambition, which
generally gives such energy to the mind, and
occasions such continued exertions as sufficiently
ward off lassitude and tædium; for
wealth cannot lull, or pleasure enervate, a
mind strongly inspired by that active principle.
Such therefore are out of the present
question. But when a full and uncontrolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
command of money comes first, and every
object of pleasure is placed within the reach
of the unambitious, all other pursuits are
too frequently despised; and every taste or
accomplishment which could inform or
strengthen the mind, and fill up the tedious
intervals of life, is neglected.</p>

<p>A young man in this situation is prone to
excess, he seldom waits the natural returns
of appetite of any kind;—his sensibility is
blunted by too frequent enjoyment;—what
is desired to-day, is lothed to-morrow;—every
thing at a distance, which bears the
name of pleasure, is an object of desire;—when
present, it becomes an object of indifference,
if not of disgust.—The agitations
of gaming are tried to prevent the horrid
stagnation of indolence:—All amusements
lose their relish, and serve to increase the
languor they were meant to expel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>As age advances, caprice, peevishness,
and tædium augment:—The scene is often
changed; but the same fretful piece is constantly
acted till the curtain is dropt, or
is pulled down by the impatient actor himself
before the natural end of the drama.</p>

<p>Does not all this happen in France and
Germany?—Doubtless; but not so often as
in England, for the reasons already mentioned.
In France, a very small proportion
of young men have the uncontrolled possession
of great fortunes. They have not
the means of gratifying every desire, and indulging
every caprice. Instead of spending
their time in clubs or taverns, with people
of their own age, the greater part of the
young nobility pass their evenings with some
private family, or in those societies of both
sexes to which they have the entrée. There
the decorum due to such company restrains
of course the vivacity and wantonness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
their behaviour and conversation; and adventures
occur which interest and amuse,
without being followed by the nausea, languor,
and remorse, which often succeed
nights spent at the gaming-table, or the
licentiousness of tavern suppers.</p>

<p>Nothing has a better influence on the temper,
disposition, and manners of a young
person, than living much in the company
of those whom he respects. Exclusive of
the improvement he may receive from their
conversation, he is habituated to self-denial,
and must relinquish many indulgencies
which lead to indolence and languor.</p>

<p>The young French nobility, even although
they should have no great share of
ambition, no love of study, no particular
turn for any of those higher accomplishments
which enable men to pass the hours
of life independent of other amusements;
yet they contrive to keep tædium at a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
by efforts of a different kind, by a
species of activity peculiar to themselves;
they perceive very early in life, the absolute
necessity of pleasing. This sentiment pervades
their general conduct, and goes a great
way in the formation of their real character.
They are attentive and obliging to all, and
particularly endeavour to acquire and retain
the friendship of those who can assist their
fortunes; and they have a relish for life,
because it is not always in their power to
anticipate enjoyment, nor can they cloy
their appetites by satiety. Even the most
dissipated among them are unacquainted
with the unbounded freedom of a tavern
life, where all the freaks of a whimsical
mind, and a capricious taste, may be indulged
without hesitation, and which, after
long indulgence, renders every other kind
of society insupportable.</p>

<p>With regard to the Germans, there are
very few men of great independent fortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
among them. The little princes, by whom
the riches of the country are engrossed,
have, I suspect, their own difficulties to get
through life with any tolerable degree of
satisfaction. As for their younger brothers
and the middling gentry, they go into the
army, and are subjected to the rigorous and
unremitting attentions of military discipline.
This, of consequence, forms a character,
in many respects different from that of the
English or French gentleman.</p>

<p>But I have not yet mentioned the circumstance,
which, of all others, perhaps
contributes the most to render London the
triste séjour which foreigners often find it;
I mean the establishment of clubs,
from which that part of the community
are excluded who have the greatest power
to soothe the cares, and enliven the pleasures
of life.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXXV">LETTER LXXXV.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>We had an invitation lately from Mons.
de Breteuil to dine on the top of
Mount Calenberg, a very high mountain in
the neighbourhood of this city. Common
coaches or chariots cannot be dragged up;
but having driven to the bottom, we found
chaises of a particular construction, calculated
for such expeditions. These had been
ordered by the Ambassador for the accommodation
of the company, and in them we
were carried to the summit, where there is
a convent of Monks, from which two
landscapes of very opposite natures appear.
The one consists of a series of wild mountains;
the other, of the town, suburbs,
and environs of Vienna, with the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
branches of the Danube flowing through a
rich champaign of boundless extent.</p>

<p>The table for dinner was covered in a
field near the convent, under the shade of
some trees.—Every delicacy of the season
was served up.—— Madame de Matignon,
a very beautiful and sprightly lady, daughter
of M. de Breteuil, did the honours.—Some
of the finest women of Vienna, her
companions, were of the company; and
the whole entertainment was conducted
with equal taste and gaiety.</p>

<p>During the dessert, some of the Fathers
came and presented the company with
baskets of fruit and sallad from their garden.—The
Ambassador invited them to sit,
and the ladies pledged them in tokay.
Mons. de Breteuil had previously obtained
permission for the ladies to enter the convent;—— which
they accordingly did, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
soon as they rose from table, attended by
all the company.</p>

<p>You will readily believe, that the appearance
of so many handsome women
would be particularly interesting to a community
which had never before beheld a
female within their walls.—This indeed
was sufficiently evident, in spite of the
gravity and mortified looks of the Fathers.</p>

<p>One lady of a gay disposition laid hold
of a little scourge which hung at one of
the Fathers’ belts, and desired he would
make her a present of it, for she wished to
use it when she returned home, having, as
she said, been a great sinner.—— The Father,
with great gallantry, begged she
would spare her own fair skin, assuring her
that he would give himself a hearty flogging
on her account that very evening;—and
to prove how much he was in earnest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
fell directly on his knees before a little
altar, and began to whip his own shoulders
with great earnestness, declaring, that when
the ladies should retire, he would lay it
with the same violence on his naked body;
for he was determined she should be as
free from sin as she was on the day of her
birth.</p>

<p>This melted the heart of the lady.—She
begged the Father might take no more of
her faults upon his shoulders.—— She now
assured him that her slips had been very
venial, and that she was convinced what
he had already done would clear her as
completely as if he should whip himself to
the bone.</p>

<p>There is something so ludicrous in all
this, that you may naturally suspect the
representation I have given, proceeds from
invention rather than memory. I assure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
you, however, in downright earnest, that
the scene passed nearly as described; and
to prevent farther mischief, I put the
scourge, which the zealous Father had
made use of, in my pocket.</p>

<p>On my return to Vienna, I called the
same evening at the Countess Walstein’s,
and soon after the Emperor came there.
Somebody had already mentioned to him
the pious gallantry of the Father at the top
of Mount Calenberg.—He asked for a sight
of the whip, which he understood I had
brought away:—I had it still in my pocket,
and immediately showed it him.—— He
laughed very heartily at the warmth of the
Father’s zeal, which he supposed had been
augmented by the Ambassador’s tokay.</p>

<p>You have often heard of the unceremonious
and easy manner in which this great
Prince lives with his subjects. Report cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
exaggerate on this head. The Countess
Walstein had no expectations of his visiting
her that evening.—— When the servant
named the Emperor before he entered, I
started up, and was going to retire.—The
Countess desired me to remain, for nothing
was more disagreeable to him than that any
company should be disturbed on his entering.—The
ladies kept their seats, some of
them knotting all the time he remained.
The men continued standing while he stood,
and when he was seated, most part of them
sat down also.—The Emperor put Count
Mahoni, the Spanish ambassador, in mind
of his gout, and made him sit, while himself
remained standing.</p>

<p>This monarch converses with all the ease
and affability of a private gentleman, and
gradually seduces others to talk with the
same ease to him. He is surely much happier
in this noble condescension, and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
acquire a more perfect knowledge of mankind,
than if he kept himself aloof from
his subjects, continually wrapt up in his
own importance and the Imperial fur.</p>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>The manners of this court are considerably
altered since Lady Mary Wortley
Montague was here, particularly since the
accession of the present Empress, whose understanding
and affability have abridged
many of the irksome ceremonials formerly
in use. Her son’s philosophical turn of
mind, and the amiable and conciliating
characters of her whole family, have no
doubt tended to put society in general upon
a more easy and agreeable footing.</p>

<p>People of different ranks now do business
together with ease, and meet at public
places without any of those ridiculous disputes
about precedency, of which the ingenious
English lady has given such lively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
descriptions.—Yet trifling punctilios are not
so completely banished, as I imagine, the
Emperor could wish, he himself being the
least punctilious person in his dominions:—for
there is certainly still a greater separation
than good sense would direct, between the
various classes of the subjects.—The sentiments
of a people change very gradually,
and it takes a course of years before reason,
or even the example of the Sovereign, can
overcome old customs and prejudices.</p>

<p>The higher, or ancient families, keep
themselves as distinct from the inferior, or
newly-created nobility, as these do from the
citizens: So that it is very difficult for the
inferior classes to be in society, or to have
their families much connected with those of
the superior ranks. And what is of more
importance in a political sense, there are certain
places of high trust in the government,
which cannot be occupied by any but the
higher order of nobility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Would you not think it disadvantageous
for a government to keep a law in force
which enacts, that the offices in the state
which require the greatest abilities, should
be filled from that class of the community
in which there is the least chance of finding
them?—Perhaps the usage above mentioned
is nearly equivalent to such a law. As for
the peasants, who are entirely out of the
question, they are, in many parts of the Emperor’s
dominions, in a state of perfect
slavery, and almost totally dependent on the
proprietors of the land.</p>

<p>The ideas relative to dress seem to have
entirely changed since Lady Mary’s time,
and if the dress of the ladies be still as absurd,
it is at least not so singular; for they,
like the rest of Europe, have now adopted
the Parisian modes.</p>

<p>The present race of Austrian ladies can
differ in nothing more than they do in looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
from their grandmothers, who, if any of
them were still alive, may be as beautiful at
this day as they were when she wrote; for
time itself could hardly improve that ugliness,
which, according to her, was in full
bloom sixty years ago. I have not as yet
enquired what method the parents have devised
to remedy this inconveniency; but
nothing is more certain than that it is remedied
very effectually, for at present there is
no scarcity of female beauty at the court of
Vienna.</p>

<p>This being the case, it is natural to imagine
that gallantry must now be more prevalent
than when her ladyship was here.
But exclusive of any real difference, which
may have happened in the sentiments of the
ladies themselves, they are obliged to observe
an uncommon degree of circumspection in
that particular, as nothing is more heinous
in the eyes of her Imperial Apostolic Majesty.
She seems to think that the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of her court, like the wife of Cæsar, should
not only be free from guilt, but, what is
still more difficult, free from suspicion, and
strongly marks by her manner, that she is
but too well informed when any piece of
scandal circulates to the prejudice of any of
them.</p>

<p>With regard to what Lady Mary calls sub-marriages,
and of which she has given such
a curious account, I do not imagine they are
common at present, in all the latitude of her
description. But it is not uncommon for
married ladies here to avow the greatest degree
of friendship and attachment to men
who are not their husbands, and to live with
them in great intimacy, without hurting
their reputation, or being suspected, even
by their own sex, of having deviated from
the laws of modesty.</p>

<p>One evening at the Count Thune’s, when
there was a pretty numerous company, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
observed one lady uncommonly sad, and enquired
of her intimate friend who happened
to be there also, if she knew the cause of this
sadness?—I do, replied she; Mr. de ——,
whom she loves very tenderly, ought to have
been here a month ago; and last night she
received a letter from him, informing her
that he cannot be at Vienna for a month to
come. But pray, said I, does your friend’s
husband know of this violent passion she has
for Mr. de ——? Yes, yes, answered she,
he knows it, and enters with the most tender
sympathy into her affliction; he does
all that can be expected from an affectionate
husband to comfort and soothe his wife,
assuring her that her love will wear away
with time. But she always declares that
she has no hopes of this, because she feels
it augment every day.—Mais, au fond, continued
the lady, cela lui fait bien de la peine,
parceque malheureusement il aime sa femme
à la folie. Et sa femme, qui est la meilleure
créature du monde, plaint infiniment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
son pauvre mari; car elle a beaucoup d’amitié
et d’estime pour lui;—mais elle ne scauroit
se défaire de cette malheureuse passion
pour Mons. de ——.</p>

<p>I was not in the least surprised that a disappointment
of this nature should affect a
woman a little; but I own it did astonish
me that she should appear in public, on
such an occasion, in all the ostentation of
sorrow, like a young widow vain of her
weeds. Here this passion was lamented by
her friends as a misfortune: In England, if
I rightly remember, such misfortunes are
generally imputed to people as crimes.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXXVII">LETTER LXXXVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Presburg.</p>

<p>The Viscount de Laval having proposed
to me lately to make a short
tour with him into Hungary, I very readily
consented, and we arrived at this town
yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Presburg, which is the capital of Lower
Hungary, like Vienna, has suburbs more
magnificent than itself. In this city the
States of Hungary hold their assemblies,
and in the cathedral church the Sovereign
is crowned.</p>

<p>The present Empress took refuge here
when the Elector of Bavaria was declared
Emperor at Prague, when she was abandoned
by her allies, and when France had planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
her destruction. Her own magnanimity,
the generous friendship of Great Britain,
and the courage of her Hungarian subjects,
at length restored her fortunes, and secured
to her family the splendid situation they
now hold in Europe.</p>

<p>What politician in 1741 could have
thought that in the course of a few years the
Empress would be in strict alliance with
France, and one of her daughters seated on
the throne of that kingdom?—Should a
soothsayer of Boston prophesy, that John
Hancock, or his son, will, sometime hence,
demand in marriage a daughter of England,—pray,
do not lay an uncommon odds,
that the thing will not happen.</p>

<p>Mons. de Laval and I walked up this
morning to the castle, which is a noble
Gothic building, of a square form, with a
tower at each corner. The regalia of Hungary,
consisting of the crown and sceptre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
St. Stephen, the first king, are deposited
here. These are carefully secured by seven
locks, the keys of which are kept by the
same number of Hungarian noblemen. No
Prince is held by the populace as legally
their Sovereign till he be crowned with the
diadem of King Stephen; and they have a
notion that the fate of their nation depends
on this crown’s remaining in their possession.
It has therefore been always removed
in times of danger to places of the greatest
safety.</p>

<p>The Turks, aware of the influence of such
a prejudice in the minds of the vulgar, have,
it is said, made frequent attempts to seize
this Palladium.—The fate of Hungary seems
now to be pretty much decided; so that exclusive
of the value they put upon the crown,
as a relic of considerable antiquity, the
Hungarians need not be solicitous whether
it remains in this castle or in the Imperial
palace at Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>By the constitution of Hungary, the
crown is still held to be elective. This point
is not disputed. All that is insisted on is,
that the heir of the House of Austria shall be
elected as often as a vacancy happens.</p>

<p>The castle of Presburg is the usual residence
of Prince Albert of Saxony, who
married one of the Arch-duchesses, a very
beautiful and accomplished Princess. As
M. de Laval and I entered one of the rooms,
we observed them at a window. We immediately
started back, and withdrew, being
in riding frocks and boots. Mons. de Laval
had seen their Highnesses a few days
before at Schonbrun, and thought they had
been there still. The Princess sent a polite
message after us by a servant, who had
orders to conduct us through every apartment
of the castle; she herself stept into
another room, that we might see that which
she left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>All the Princesses of the Austrian family
are distinguished by an attentive and obliging
politeness, which is the more remarkable,
as those who live much at courts often acquire
a species of politeness which is by no
means obliging. The splendor and distinctions
of a court frequently inspire an
overweening vanity, and have a peculiar
tendency to shake the steadiness of the female
understanding. Court ladies in general,
but particularly such as submit to be
abject sycophants to Queens and Princesses,
are apt to render themselves ridiculous by
the arrogant airs they assume to the rest of
the world, and while they usurp the importance
of royalty, fill the breasts of all
who know them with as much detestation
as is consistent with contempt.</p>

<p>The view from this citadel is very extensive,
commanding the vast and fertile plains
of Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Having dined at the inn, and regaled
ourselves, at no great expence, with tokay,
we went to visit a villa at the distance of
four miles from Presburg, belonging to a
Hungarian nobleman. This house is delightfully
situated,—the gardens laid out a
little too methodically; but the park, and
fields around, where less art has been used,
display a vast luxuriancy of natural beauties.—While
wandering over these, we entered
a little wood in a very retired place; as we
advanced into this, we saw a venerable looking
old man with a long beard, who,
stretching out his hand, seemed to invite us
to an hermitage which we observed hard by.</p>

<p>The Viscount, impatient to cultivate the
acquaintance of a person of such an hospitable
appearance, ran before me toward him;
when he got up to him, he stopped short,
as if surprised, and then, to my utter astonishment,
he raised his foot with every mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
indignation, and gave the poor old hermit
a violent kick.</p>

<p>I do not remember that I was ever more
shocked in my life; I was at the same time
quite confounded at an action so unworthy
in itself, and so incompatible with the character
of Mons. de Laval.—I was soon reconciled,
however, to the treatment the old
fellow had received, when I discovered that
this venerable personage was not the honest
man we took him for, but a downright impostor,
made of painted wood, and dressed
in the robes of a hermit to deceive passengers.</p>

<p>Over the door was an inscription from
Horace—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Odi profanum vulgus,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the inside of the door—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Fata volentes ducunt, nolentes trahunt.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>And in another part, within the hermitage—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Omnes eodem cogimur: omnium</div>
<div class="verse">Versatur urna, serius ocius,</div>
<div class="verse">Sors exitura, et nos in æternum</div>
<div class="verse">Exilium impositura Cymbæ.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There were also several inscriptions taken
from Cicero, in favour of the soul’s immortality,
which I am sorry I neglected to
transcribe.—We returned in the evening to
this place, and are to set out to-morrow
for Prince Estherhasie’s.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXXVIII">LETTER LXXXVIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>Having left Presburg, we travelled
eight posts across a very fertile country
to the palace of Estherhasie, the residence
of the Prince of that name. He is the
first in rank of the Hungarian nobility, and
one of the most magnificent subjects in Europe.
He has body-guards of his own, all
genteel-looking men, richly dressed in the
Hungarian manner.</p>

<p>The palace is a noble building, lately
finished, and situated near a fine lake. The
apartments are equally grand and commodious:
the furniture more splendid than almost
any thing I have seen in royal palaces.
In the Prince’s own apartment there are
some curious musical clocks, and one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
shape of a bird, which whistles a tune every
hour.</p>

<p>Just by the palace, there is a theatre for
operas, and other dramatic entertainments,
and in the gardens, a large room with commodious
apartments for masquerades and
balls.</p>

<p>At no great distance, there is another
theatre expressly built for puppet-shows.
This is much larger and more commodious
than most provincial playhouses, and I am
bold to assert, is the most splendid that has
as yet been reared in Europe for that species
of actors. We regretted that we could not
have the pleasure of seeing them perform;
for they have the reputation of being the
best comedians in Hungary.</p>

<p>We had the curiosity to peep behind the
curtain, and saw Kings, Emperors, Turks,
and Christians, all ranged very sociably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
together.—King Solomon was observed in a
corner in a very suspicious tête-à-tête with
the Queen of Sheba.</p>

<p>Amongst other curiosities, there is in the
garden a wooden house, built upon wheels.
It contains a room with a table, chairs, a
looking-glass, chimney, and fire-place. There
are also closets, with many necessary accommodations.—The
Prince sometimes entertains
twelve people in this vehicle, all of
whom may easily sit round the table, and
the whole company may thus take an airing
together along the walks of the garden, and
many parts of the park, which are as level
as a bowling-green. The machine, when
thus loaded, is easily drawn by six or eight
horses.</p>

<p>Prince Estherhasie having heard of M. de
Laval’s being in the garden, sent us an invitation
to the opera, which was to be performed
that evening; but as we had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
with us no dress proper for such an occasion,
we were forced to decline this obliging
invitation.—The Prince afterwards sent
a carriage, in which we drove round the
garden and parks. These are of vast extent,
and beautiful beyond description; arbours,
fountains, walks, woods, hills, and
valleys, being thrown together in a charming
confusion.—If you will look over
Ariosto’s description of the gardens in Alcina’s
inchanted island, you will have an
idea of the romantic fields of Estherhasie,
which are also inhabited by the same kind
of animals.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Tra le purpuree rose e i bianchi gigli,</div>
<div class="verse">Cha tepid aura freschi ognora serba,</div>

<div class="verse">Senza temer che alcun li uccida o pigli,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>M. de Laval was in raptures with the
gardens of Estherhasie. In the height of
his admiration, I asked him how they
stood in his opinion, compared with those
of Versailles?</p>

<p>Ah, Parbleu! Monsieur, answered he,
Versailles étoit fait exprès pour n’être comparé
à rien.—He acknowledged, however,
without difficulty, that, except France,
no other country he had seen was so beautiful
as this.</p>

<p>Having wandered here many hours, we
returned to the inn, where a servant waited
with Prince Estherhasie’s compliments,
and a basket containing two bottles of
Tokay, and the same quantity of Champaign
and of Old Hock. We lamented very
sincerely, that we could not have the honour
of waiting on this very magnificent
Prince, and thanking him personally for so
much politeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>A company of Italian singers and actors
were then at the inn, and preparing for the
opera. Great preparations were making
for the entertainment of the Empress and
all the Court, who are soon to make a visit
of several days to Estherhasie. Though
the Imperial family, and many of the nobility,
are to lodge in the palace, yet every
corner of this large and commodious inn is
already bespoke for the company which are
invited upon that occasion.</p>

<p>Hungary is a very cheap country, the
land being infinitely fertile, and in some
places producing the most esteemed grape
in Europe. It is beautiful with lakes,
the windings of the Danube, and many
streams which flow into that fine river. In
the woods of Hungary are bred a race of
horses, the most active, hardy, and spirited,
for their size, in the world. These
have been found very useful in war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the hussars, or light dragoons of the Austrian
army, are mounted on them.</p>

<p>The men in Hungary are remarkably
handsome, and well-shaped. Their appearance
is improved by their dress, which
you know is peculiar, and very becoming.</p>

<p>Lady M. W. Montague asserts, that the
Hungarian women are far more beautiful
than the Austrian. For my part, I think
of women, as M. de Laval does of Versailles;—that
they are not to be compared
with any thing,—not even with one another.
And therefore, without presuming
to take a comparative view of their beauty,
it may be remarked in general, that where
the men are handsome and well-made, it
is natural to suppose, that the women will
possess the same advantages; for parents
generally bestow as much attention to the
making of their daughters as of their
sons. In confirmation of which doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
I can assure you, that I have seen as handsome
women, as men, in Hungary, and
one of the prettiest women, in my opinion,
at present at the Court of Vienna, is a
Hungarian.</p>

<p>None of the Empress’s subjects are taxed
so gently, or enjoy so many privileges as
the Hungarians. This is partly owing to
the grateful remembrance she has of their
loyalty and attachment in the days of her
distress. But although this sentiment were
not so strong in her breast as it really is,
there are political reasons for continuing to
them the same exemptions and privileges;
for nothing can be more dangerous than disobliging
the inhabitants of a frontier country,
which borders on an inveterate enemy.—Nor
could any thing please the Turks
more, than to find the hearts of the Hungarians
alienated from the house of Austria.</p>

<p>I found this country, and the company
of M. de Laval, so very agreeable, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
should have been happy to have extended
our excursion farther; but he is obliged to
set out soon for Chamberry to pay his duty
to the Comte d’Artois, who is expected
there to wait on his future spouse, the
Princess of Savoy. We therefore returned
by the direct road from Estherhasie to
Vienna.</p>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>So the fate of poor —— is finally decided,
and he now finds, that to be ruined
is not a matter of so much indifference as
he once imagined. I neither see the possibility
of his extricating himself from his
present difficulties, nor in what manner he
will be able to support them. Accustomed
to every luxuriant indulgence, how can
he bear the inconveniencies of poverty?—Dissipated
and inattentive from his childhood,
how can he make any exertion for
himself?—His good-humour, genteel figure,
and pliant disposition, made him well
received by all.—While he formed no expectations
from their friendship, his company
seemed particularly acceptable to some
who are at present in power: Whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
will be equally so now, when he has nothing
else to depend on, is to be tried.
And I really think it as well for him
that it be tried now, as five or six years
hence.</p>

<p>This calamity has been long foreseen.—There
seemed to be almost a necessity that
it should happen sooner or later; for he had
neither caution, plan, nor object in his
gaming.—He continued it from habit
alone. Of all mankind, he was the least
covetous of excessive wealth; and exclusive
of gaming, he always lived within his income,
not from a desire of saving money,
but merely because he had no taste for great
expence.—How often have we seen him
lose immense sums to those who could never
have paid the half, had he happened to
win it; and to some of whom he had
lent the money which enabled them to
stake against him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many careless young men of
great fortunes, who game in the same
style, and from no other motives than
those of our unhappy friend.—What is
the consequence?—The money circulates
for a while among them, but remains
finally with persons of a very different
character.—I shall not suppose that any of
the very fortunate gamesters we have been
acquainted with, have used those means
to correct fortune which are generally
reckoned fraudulent. I am fully persuaded,
they are seldomer practised in the
clubs in London, than in any other gaming
societies in the world.—Let all slight of
hand, and every species of downright
sharping, be put out of the question; but
still we may suppose, that among a great
number of careless inattentive people of
fortune, a few wary, cool and shrewd
men are mingled, who know how to conceal
real caution and design under apparent
inattention and gaiety of manner;—who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
have a perfect command of themselves,
push their luck when fortune
smiles, and refrain when she changes her
disposition;—who have calculated the
chances, and understand every game where
judgment is required.</p>

<p>If there are such men, is not the probability
of winning infinitely in their favour?—Does
it not amount to almost as
great a certainty, as if they had actually
loaded the dice or packed the cards?—I
know you live in the habit of intimacy
with some who answer to the above description;
and I have heard you say, that
however fortunate they may have been,
you were fully convinced that nothing
can be fairer than their manner of playing.
I accuse them of taking no other advantages
than those above mentioned; but I appeal
to your own experience,—pray recollect,
and I am greatly mistaken, if you will not
find, that by far the greater part of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
who have made fortunes by play, and
have kept them when made, are men of
cool, cautious, shrewd, and selfish characters.</p>

<p>If any of these very fortunate people
were brought to a trial, and examined by
what means they had accumulated such
sums, while so many others had entirely
lost, or greatly impaired their fortunes (if
the word esprit be allowed to imply that
artful superiority which belongs to their
characters), they might answer in the
words of the wife of Concini Marechal
d’Ancre, when she was asked what charm
she had made use of to fascinate the mind
of the Queen?—De l’ascendant, she replied,
qu’un esprit superieur a toujours sur
des esprits foibles.—Certainly there can
be no greater weakness, than for a man of
independent fortune to game in such a
manner as to risk losing it, for the chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
of doubling or tripling his income: because
the additional happiness arising from
any supposable addition of wealth, can
never be within a thousand degrees so great,
as the misery which would be the consequence
of his being stripped of his original
fortune.</p>

<p>This consideration alone, one would
imagine, might be sufficient to deter any
reasonable man from a conduct so weak
and absurd: yet there are other considerations
which give much additional weight to
the argument;—the dismal effects which the
continued practice of gaming has sometimes
been observed to produce in the disposition
of the mind, and the most essential
parts of the character, destroying every
idea of œconomy, engrossing the whole
time, undermining the best principles, perverting
the qualities of the heart, rendering
men callous to the ruin of acquaintances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
and partakers, with a savage insensibility,
in the spoils of their unwary
friends.</p>

<p>The peculiar instances with which you
and I are acquainted, where the long-continued
habit of deep play has had no such
effects, are proofs of the rooted honour and
integrity of certain individuals, and may
serve as exceptions to a general rule, but
cannot be urged as arguments against the
usual tendency of gaming. If men of fortune
and character adopted the practice
of gaming upon any principle of reasoning,
there might be a greater probability of
their being reasoned out of it: but most of
them begin to game, not with any view or
fixed plan of increasing their wealth, but
merely as a fashionable amusement, or perhaps
by way of showing the liberality
of their spirit, and their contempt for
money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>I would not be very positive, that some
of them have not mistaken for admiration
that surprise which is expressed when any
person has lost an immense sum. And this
mistake may have given them less repugnance
to the idea of becoming the objects of
admiration in the same day. Afterwards
endeavouring to win back what they had
so idly lost, the habit has grown by degrees,
and at length has become their sole
resource from the weariness which those
born to great fortunes, and who have not
early in life acquired some faculty of amusing
themselves, are more prone to fall into
than others. Men born to no such expectations,
whatever their natural dispositions
may be, are continually roused from
indolence by avocations which admit of
no delay. The pursuit of that independence,
for which almost every human bosom
sighs, and whose value is unknown
only to those who have always possessed it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
is thought a necessary, and is often sound,
an agreeable employment to the generality
of mankind. This, with the other duties
of life, is sufficient to engross their time
and thoughts, and guard them from <i>the
pains and penalties of idleness</i>.</p>

<p>As the pursuit of wealth is superfluous
in men of rank and fortune, so it would be
unbecoming their situation. Being deprived
of this, which is so great an object
and resource to the rest of mankind, they
stand in more need of something to supply
its place. I know of nothing which can
so completely, and with so much propriety,
have this effect, as a taste for letters and
love of science. I therefore think these
are more essentially necessary to the happiness
of people of high rank and great fortune,
than to those in confined circumstances.</p>

<p>If independence be desired with universal
ardour by mankind, the road of science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
is neither the most certain, nor the shortest
way to attain it. But those who are already
in possession of this, have infinite
need of the other to teach them to enjoy
their independence with dignity and satisfaction,
and to prevent the gifts of fortune
from becoming sources of misery instead of
happiness. If they are ambitious, the cultivation
of letters, by adorning their minds,
and enlarging their faculties, will facilitate
their plans, and render them more fit for
the high situations to which they aspire.
If they are devoid of ambition, they have
still more occasion for some of the pursuits
of science, as resources against the languor
of retired or inactive life.—Quod si non hic
tantus fructus ostenderetur, et si ex his studiis
delectatio sola peteretur; tamen, ut opinor,
hanc animi remissionem, humanissimam ac
liberalissimam judicaretis.</p>

<p>This love of letters considered merely as
an amusement, and to fill up agreeably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the vacant hours of life, I believe to be
more essentially necessary to men of great
fortune than to those who have none;—to
men without ambition, than to those who
are animated by that active passion; and to
the generality of Englishmen more than to
the natives of either Germany or France.—The
Germans require very little variety.
They can bear the languid uniformity of
life always with patience, and often with
satisfaction. They display an equanimity
under disgust that is quite astonishing.—The
French, though not so celebrated for
patience, are of all mankind the least liable
to despondence. Public affairs, so apt to
disturb the repose of many worshipful citizens
of London, never give a Frenchman
uneasiness. If the arms of France are successful,
he rejoices with all his heart;—if
they are unfortunate, he laughs at the commanders
with all his soul. If his mistress
is kind, he celebrates her goodness and commends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
her taste;—if she is cruel, he derides
her folly in the arms of another.</p>

<p>No people ever were so fond of amusement,
and so easily amused. It seems to
be the chief object of their lives, and they
contrive to draw it from a thousand sources,
in which no other people ever thought it
could be found. I do not know where I
met with the following lines; they are natural
and easy, and seem expressive of the
conduct and sentiments of the whole French
nation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">M’amuser n’importe comment,</div>
<div class="verse">Fait toute ma philosophie.</div>
<div class="verse">Je crois ne perdre aucun moment</div>
<div class="verse">Hors le moment où je m’ennuie;</div>
<div class="verse">Et je tiens ma tâche finie,</div>
<div class="verse">Pourvu qu’ainsi tout doucement;</div>
<div class="verse">Je me defasse de la vie.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Our countrymen who have applied to
letters, have prosecuted every branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
science as successfully as any of their neighbours.
But those of them who study
mere amusement, independent of literature
of any kind, certainly have not been so
happy in their researches as the French.
Many things which entertain the latter,
seem frivolous and insipid to the former. The
English view objects through a darker medium.
Less touched than their neighbours
with the gaieties, they are more affected
by the vexations of life, under which
they are too ready to despond. They feel
their spirits flag with the repetition of
scenes which at first were thought agreeable.
This stagnation of animal spirits,
from whatever cause it arises, becomes itself
a cause of desperate resolutions, and debating
habits.</p>

<p>A man of fortune, therefore, who can
acquire such a relish for science, as will
make him rank its pursuits among his
amusements; has thereby made an acquisition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of more importance to his happiness,
than if he had acquired another estate equal
in value to his first. I am almost convinced,
that a taste of this kind is the only
thing which can render a man of fortune
(especially if his fortune be very large) tolerably
independent and easy through life.
Whichsoever of the roads of science he
loves to follow, his curiosity will continually
be kept awake. An inexhaustible variety
of interesting objects will open to his
view,—his mind will be replenished with
ideas,—and even when the pursuits of ambition
become insipid, he will still have antidotes
against tædium, and (other things
being supposed equal) the best chance of
passing agreeably through life, that the uncertainty
of human events allows to man.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XC">LETTER XC.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>In your last, you show such a passion
for anecdote, and seem so desirous of
my insisting on manners and characters,
that I fear you will not be pleased with my
last long epistle upon a subject entirely
remote from what you demand. But you
must remember that you were warned
from the beginning of this correspondence,
that I would retain the privilege of digressing
as often as I pleased, and that my
letters should frequently treat of what I
thought, as well as what I saw. However,
this shall consist entirely of sights.</p>

<p>The first I shall mention was exhibited
soon after our arrival at Vienna. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the feast of St. Stephen, at which the Emperor
dined in public with the knights.</p>

<p>He was at the head of the table; his
brother and brother-in-law next him, and
the other knights sat according to seniority.
The Arch-duchesses, with some of the
principal ladies of the court, were at a
balcony within the hall to see this ceremony.—The
Emperor and all the knights
were dressed in the robes of the order.
The Hungarian guards, with their sabres
drawn, surrounded the table.</p>

<p>The honour of serving the Emperor at
this solemnity belongs entirely to the Hungarians.
When he called for drink, a
Hungarian nobleman poured a little of the
wine into a cup and tasted it; he afterwards
filled another, which he presented
with one knee touching the ground. The
Emperor often smiled upon this nobleman
as he went through the ceremony, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
seemed to indicate by the whole of his
behaviour, that he considered such submissive
bendings of one man to another,
as greatly misplaced, and that he suffered
this mummery merely in compliance with
ancient custom.</p>

<p>There was great crowding to see this
feast, and it was not without difficulty
I got admission; though, after all, there
was nothing to be seen but some well-dressed
men, who ate an exceeding good
dinner with tolerable appetite.</p>

<p>Since the feast of St. Stephen, we have
been witnesses to the annual ceremony in
commemoration of the defeat of the Turkish
army, and the raising the siege of Vienna
by John Sobieski king of Poland.
The Imperial family and the principal nobility
of both sexes walked in solemn procession,
and heard mass at the church of
St. Stephen on this occasion. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
middle of the street, leading from the
palace to the church, a platform was
raised, upon which the company, who
formed the procession, walked.—The
streets were lined with the Imperial guards,
and the windows and tops of the houses
were crowded with spectators.—The D—— of
H—— and I found a very good situation
at a window with the Venetian ambassador.</p>

<p>This ceremony would have been too
fatiguing for the Empress:—She therefore
did not attend:—The Emperor, the
Arch-dukes and Duchesses, with all the
nobility, did. A prodigious train of bishops,
priests, and monks followed; and
a numerous band of music played as they
went along.</p>

<p>As this is a day of rejoicing, the richest
and gayest dresses are thought the most expressive
of the pious gratitude becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
such an occasion. The ladies displayed
their devotion in the most brilliant manner.
Their minds, however, were not so much
exalted by heavenly contemplations, as to
be above taking notice of their earthly
acquaintances at the windows, whom they
regaled with smiles and nods as they
walked along.</p>

<p>Next day the Imperial family dined in
public, and many people went to see them.
I was not of the number, though nobody
can more sincerely wish them the enjoyment
of all the comforts of life. I know
not on what principle the Royal Family
in France, and other countries in Europe,
have adopted the custom of eating in public.
They cannot imagine, that the seeing
them chew and swallow their victuals
can create a vast deal of admiration in the
beholders. It would certainly be taken
for granted, that they could perform these
necessary functions, although a cloud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
witnesses were not admitted to confirm the
fact. If these exhibitions are designed for
the entertainment of the subjects, a thousand
could be thought of more amusing
to them; for however interesting the part
of an actor at a feast may be, that of a
spectator is surely one of the most insipid
that can be imagined.</p>

<p>But the same evening there was a grand
masquerade at Schonbrun, which was more
generally amusing.—Four thousand tickets
were distributed on this occasion.—A
large party of dragoons were placed
along the road from Vienna, to keep the
coaches in a regular line, and to prevent
confusion. The principal rooms of this
magnificent palace were thrown open for
the reception of the company.—In three
large halls on the ground-floor, tables
were covered with a cold collation of all
kinds of fowls, ham, and confections, with
pine-apples and every sort of fruit. These,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
with Old Hock, Champagne, and other
kinds of wine, were served with readiness
and profusion to all who asked for them.</p>

<p>At the end of the large dining-room,
there was a raised seat for the Empress,
and some ladies who attended her. Here
a grand Ballet was danced by the Arch-duke,
the Arch-duchesses, the Princess
of Modena, and some of the chief nobility,
to the number of twenty-four. The
dancers, both male and female, were
dressed in white silk, flounced with pink-coloured
ribands, and enriched with a vast
profusion of diamonds.</p>

<p>This ballet was performed three times
at proper intervals. Those who had seen
it once, passed into the gallery, and other
apartments, giving way to a new set of
spectators. In the garden, on a rising
ground opposite to the palace windows, a
temporary fabric was erected in the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
of a large and magnificent temple. This
was illuminated by an incredible number
of lamps, and gave the appearance of a
very extraordinary piece of architecture,
which continued flaming through the
whole night, and had a very fine effect,
viewed from Vienna, and other places at a
greater distance.</p>

<p>The Emperor mixed with the company
without ceremony or distinction, taking
no part himself but as a spectator.
He was conversing in the middle of the
hall, in the most familiar manner, with
an English gentleman, without observing,
that the third ballet was going to be
danced, when the master of the ceremonies
whispered him in the ear.—The Emperor,
seizing the Englishman by the arm,
said, Allons, Monsieur, on nous chasse—il
faut se retirer; and immediately walked
into another room, to give place to others
who had not yet seen the dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>This very splendid entertainment was
given to the Arch-duke, and the Princess
of Modena, whose usual residence is at
Milan.—The Empress, thus surrounded by
her offspring, appeared cheerful and happy.—She
seemed to enjoy the vivacity, and
sympathize with the gaiety, of the company.—She
is greatly beloved by her own
children, and by her subjects in general,
whom she also considers as her children in a
greater degree than is usual for sovereigns.</p>

<p>It is an error to imagine, that great devotion
has a tendency to sour the temper:
Though it must be acknowledged, that it
has not always the power of sweetening
the very austere trunks on which it is sometimes
grafted; but in a character naturally
benevolent, every good disposition will be
strengthened and animated by real piety.
Of this I have seen a thousand instances,
and I believe her Imperial Majesty affords
one.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XCI">LETTER XCI.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>The Emperor is of a middle size, well
made, and of a fair complexion. He
has a considerable resemblance to his sister,
the Queen of France, which, in my opinion,
is saying a great deal in favour of his
looks.—Till I saw something of his usual
behaviour, I did not think it possible for a
person in such an elevated situation, to put
every body with whom he conversed upon
so easy a footing.</p>

<p>His manner, as I have often mentioned,
is affable, obliging, and perfectly free from
the reserved and lofty deportment assumed
by some on account of high birth. Whoever
has the honour to be in company with
him, so far from being checked by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
despicable pride, has need to be on his
guard, not to adopt such a degree of familiarity
as, whatever the condescension of
the one might permit, would be highly improper
in the other to use.</p>

<p>He is regular in his way of life, moderate
in his pleasures, steady in his plans,
and diligent in business. He is fond of
his army, and inclines that the soldiers
should have every comfort and necessary
consistent with their situation. He is certainly
an œconomist, and lavishes very
little money on useless pomp, mistresses, or
favourites; and it is, I suppose, on no better
foundation than this, that his enemies
accuse him of avarice.</p>

<p>I cannot help regarding œconomy as
one of the most useful qualities in a Prince.
Liberality, even when pushed to an imprudent
length, may, in a private person,
proceed from a kind of greatness of mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
because his fortune is in every sense his
own, and he can injure nobody but himself
by lavishing it away.—He knows that
when it is gone, nobody will reimburse
him for his extravagance.—He seems
therefore to have taken the resolution to
submit to the inconveniency of future poverty,
rather than renounce the present
happiness of acting with a magnificent liberality,
and bestowing on others more
than he can afford.</p>

<p>This is not the case with a Prince.—What
he squanders is not his own, but
the public money.—He knows that his
pomp and splendour will be kept up, and
that his subjects, not he, are to feel the
inconveniencies of his prodigality. When
I hear, therefore, that a King has given
great sums of money to any particular person;
from the sums given, the person who
receives it, the motive for the gift, and
other circumstances, I can judge whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
it is well or ill disposed of; but in either
case, it cannot be called generosity.</p>

<p>The virtue of generosity consists in a
man’s depriving himself of something for
the sake of another. There can be no generosity
in giving to John what James
must replace the next moment. What is
called generosity in Kings, very often consists
in bestowing that money on the idle
part of their subjects which they have
squeezed from the industrious. I have
heard a parcel of fiddlers and opera dancers
praise a Prince for his noble and generous
behaviour to them, while men near his
person of useful talents and real worth were
distressed for bread.—The Emperor certainly
has none of that kind of generosity.</p>

<p>His usual dress (the only one indeed in
which I ever saw him, except at the feast
of the Knights of St. Stephen) is a plain
uniform of white faced with red.—When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
he goes to Laxenberg, Schonbrun, and
other places near Vienna, he generally
drives two horses in an open chaise, with
a servant behind, and no other attendant
of any kind.—He very seldom allows the
guard to turn out as he passes through the
gate.—Nobody ever had a stronger disposition
to judicious inquiry.—He is fond of
conversing with ingenious people.—When
he hears of any person, of whatever rank
or country, being distinguished for any
particular talent, he is eager to converse
with him, and turns the conversation to
the subject on which that person is thought
to excel, drawing from him all the useful
information he can. Of all the means of
knowledge, this is perhaps the most powerful,
and the most proper that can be used
by one whose more necessary occupations
do not leave him much time for study.</p>

<p>He seems to be of opinion, that the
vanity and ignorance of many Princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
are frequently owing to the forms in
which they are intrenched, and to their
being deprived of the advantages which
the rest of mankind enjoy from a free
comparison and exchange of sentiment.
He is convinced, that unless a King can
contrive to live in some societies on a footing
of equality, and can weigh his own
merit, without throwing his guards and
pomp into the scale, it will be difficult
for him to know either the world or himself.</p>

<p>One evening at the Countess Walstein’s,
the conversation leading that way, the Emperor
enumerated some remarkable and ludicrous
instances of the inconveniencies of
etiquette, which had occurred at a certain
court. One person present hinted at the
effectual means his Majesty had used to
banish every inconveniency of that kind
from the Court of Vienna. To which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
replied, It would be hard indeed, if, because
I have the ill fortune to be an Emperor,
I should be deprived of the pleasures
of social life, which are so much to my
taste. All the grimace and parade to
which people in my situation are accustomed
from their cradle, have not made me
so vain, as to imagine that I am in any
essential quality superior to other men; and
if I had any tendency to such an opinion,
the surest way to get rid of it, is the method
I take, of mixing in society, where I
have daily occasions of finding myself inferior
in talents to those I meet with. Conscious
of this, it would afford me no enjoyment
to assume airs of a superiority
which I feel does not exist. I endeavour
therefore to please, and to be pleased; and
as much as the inconveniency of my situation
will permit, to enjoy the blessings of
society like other men, convinced that the
man who is secluded from those, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
raises himself above friendship, is also raised
above happiness, and deprived of the means
of acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p>This kind of language is not uncommon
with poor philosophers; but I imagine
it is rarely held by Princes, and the
inferences to be drawn from it more rarely
put in practice.</p>

<p>A few days after this, there was an exhibition
of fire-works on the Prater. This
is a large park, planted with wood, and
surrounded by the Danube, over which
there is a wooden bridge. No carriages
being allowed to pass, the company leave
their coaches at one end, and walk. There
is a narrow path railed off on one side
of the bridge. Many people very injudiciously
took this path, to which there is
an easy entrance at one end, but the exit
is difficult at the other; for only one person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
can go out at a time. The path
therefore was very soon choaked up;
the unfortunate passengers crept on at a
snail’s pace, and in the most straitened
and disagreeable manner imaginable; whilst
those who had kept the wide path in the
middle of the bridge, like the fortunate
and wealthy in their journey through life,
moved along at their ease, totally regardless
of the wretched circumstances of their fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>Some few of the prisoners in the narrow
passage, who were of a small size,
and uncommon address, crawled under
the rail, and got into the broad walk
in the middle; but all who were tall,
and of a larger make, were obliged to
remain and submit to their fate. An
Englishman, who had been at the Countess
Walstein’s when the Emperor expressed
himself as above mentioned, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of the last class. The Emperor, as he
passed, seeing that those of a small size
extricated themselves, while the Englishman
remained fixed in a very aukward
situation, called out, Ah, Monsieur! Je
vous ai bien annoncé combien il est incommode
d’être trop <i>grand</i>.—A present
vous devez être bien de mon avis;—Mais
comme je ne puis rien faire pour
vous soulager, je vous recommende à Saint
George.</p>

<p>There are people who, having heard
of the Emperor’s uncommon affability,
and of his total contempt of pomp and
parade, of which the bulk of mankind
are so much enamoured, have asserted,
that the whole is affectation. But if
the whole tenor of any person’s words
and actions is to be considered as affectation,
I do not know by what means we
are to get at the bottom of his real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
character. Yet, people who have a
violent taste for any particular thing,
are extremely ready to believe, that those
who have not the same taste are affected.</p>

<p>I do not remember that I ever told
you, that our friend R——, who loves
his bottle above all things, and who,
I believe, esteems you above all men,
let me into a part of your character
of which I never had the smallest suspicion.</p>

<p>One day after dinner, when a couple
of bottles had awakened his friendship,
and laid open his heart, he took it into
his head to enumerate your good
qualities, and concluded the list, by saying,
that you were no milk-sop.—I know
what that expression imports in the
mouth of R——. I therefore stared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
and said, I had seldom seen you drink
above three glasses at a time in my life.—Nor
I, said he; but take my word for
it, he is too honest a fellow not to love
good wine, and I am certain his sobriety
is all affectation.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XCII">LETTER XCII.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>I returned very lately from Prince Lichtenstein’s
house at Felberg in Austria,
where I passed a few days very agreeably.
The Lichtenstein family is one of the first
in this country, whether considered in
point of antiquity, wealth or dignity. This
Prince, besides his lands in Austria, has
considerable estates in Bohemia, Moravia,
and that part of Silesia which belongs to
the Empress. Like Prince Estherhasie, he
has body-guards in his own pay.—I believe
no other subjects in Europe retain this
distinction.</p>

<p>Felberg is a fine old mansion, about forty
miles from Vienna. The apartments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
large, convenient, and furnished in the
magnificent style which prevails in the noblemen’s
houses of this country. The
company consisted of the Prince and Princess,
the Count Degenfeldt and his Lady,
a very accomplished woman; the D—— of
H——, Mr. M——, an English officer, another
English gentleman, and myself. Our
entertainment was in every respect splendid,
particularly in the article of attendants.
Some of the Austrian nobility carry this
point of magnificence to a height, which
could scarcely be supported by the best
estates in England, where one footman is
more expensive than four in this country.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival, breakfast was
served to the company separately in their
own apartments, as is the custom here.
We afterwards set out for another villa
belonging to this Prince, at six miles distance,
where he intended to give the D—— the
amusement of hunting. The Princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the Countess Degenfeldt, the D——,
and Captain M——, were in one coach;
the Prince, the Count, and I, in another;
the two young Princes, with their governor
and the young English gentleman, in
a third, with a great retinue on horseback.</p>

<p>As the day was well advanced when we
arrived, I imagined the hunting would begin
immediately:—But every thing is done
with method and good order in this country,
and it was judged proper to dine in
the first place. This in due time being
concluded, I thought the men would have
proceeded directly to the scene of action,
leaving the ladies till their return.—But
here I found myself again mistaken:—The
ladies were to assist in the whole of this
expedition. But as there was a necessity
to traverse a large wood, into which coaches
could not enter, vehicles of a more commodious
construction were prepared. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
forget what name is given to these carriages.
They are of the form of benches,
with stuffed seats, upon which six or eight
people may place themselves one behind
the other. They are drawn by four
horses, and slide over the ground like a
sledge, passing along paths and trackless
ways, over which no wheel-carriage could
be drawn.</p>

<p>After being conveyed in this manner
across the wood, and a considerable way
beyond it, we came to a very large open
field, in which there were several little
circular inclosures of trees and underwood
at wide intervals from each other.—This
hunting had hitherto been attended with
very little fatigue; for we had been carried
the whole way in coaches, or on the
sledges, which are still easier than any
coach. In short, we had been perfectly
passive since breakfast, except during the
time of dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>But when we arrived at this large plain,
I was informed, that the hunting would
commence within a very short time. I
then expected we should have some violent
exercise after so much inactivity, and
began to fear that the ladies might be
over-fatigued, when, lo! the Prince’s servants
began to arrange some portable chairs
at a small distance from one of the thickets
above mentioned. The Princess, Countess,
and the rest of the company took
their places; and when every body was
seated, they assured me that the hunting
was just going to begin.</p>

<p>I own, my curiosity was now excited in
a very uncommon degree; and I was filled
with impatience to see the issue of a hunting,
which had been conducted in a style
so different from any idea I had of that diversion.
While I sat lost in conjecture,
I perceived, at a great distance, a long line
of people moving towards the little wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
near which the company was seated. As
they walked along, they gradually formed
the segment of a circle, whose centre was
this wood. I understood that these were
peasants, with their wives and children,
who, walking forward in this manner,
rouse the game, which naturally take shelter
in the thicket of trees and bushes. As
soon as this happened, the peasants rushed
in at the side opposite to that where our
company had taken post, beat out the
game, and then the massacre began.</p>

<p>Each person was provided with a fusil,
and many more were at hand loaded for
immediate use. The servants were employed
in charging as fast as the pieces
were fired off: So that an uninterrupted
shooting was kept up, as long as the game
continued flying or running out of the
wood—The Prince hardly ever missed.—He
himself killed above thirty partridges,
a few pheasants, and three hares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning of this scene, I was a
good deal surprised to see a servant hand
a fusil to the Princess, who with great
coolness, and without rising from her seat,
took aim at a partridge, which immediately
fell to the ground. With the same
ease, she killed ten or twelve partridges
and pheasants, at about double the number
of shots.—The execution done by the
rest of the company was by no means considerable.</p>

<p>Though I had not heard of it before,
I now understood, that shooting is not an
uncommon amusement with the German
ladies: And it is probable, their attention
to the delicacy of the fair sex, has induced
the hardy Germans to render this diversion
so little fatiguing.</p>

<p>The company afterwards walked to
other little inclosures of planting, where
some game was driven out and killed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
before.—The following day, the Prince
conducted us to another of his seats, where
there is a very fine open wood, full of
deer of every kind, some of them the
largest I ever saw. There is also a great
number of wild boars, one of which, by
the Prince’s permission, the D—— of H——
killed.</p>

<p>Nothing could surpass the politeness and
magnificence with which the company
were entertained during the whole of their
stay. The Princess is a woman of an amiable
character, and a good understanding;
educates her children, and manages her
affairs with the utmost prudence and propriety.</p>

<p>This family, and many of the nobility,
who have hitherto been at their country-seats,
are now about to return to Vienna.
The family of Monsieur and Madame de
Pergen have been here for some time. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
lady is an intimate friend of the Countess
Thune; and nearly the same company,
who form her society, now assemble twice
a week at the house of Madame de Pergen,
who rivals the Countess in good sense and
many accomplishments, and, without raising
jealousy or ill-will, divides with her
the esteem of the best company of this
place. The agreeable footing on which
society is established here, and the number
of respectable people with whom we are
acquainted, fills me with regret at the
thoughts of leaving Vienna; but the D—— of
H—— inclines to pass the winter in Italy.
Indeed, if he did not, he would be obliged
to delay the journey a whole year, or submit
to the inconveniencies of travelling in
the summer months, which, in so hot a
climate, is rather to be avoided.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XCIII">LETTER XCIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>I have not said any thing of the Austrian
army, having some suspicion that I
rather over-dosed you with military details
from Berlin, where the subject of
my letters was continually before my eyes.
But the Emperor has very few of his troops
in garrison at Vienna. They make a
fine appearance, and the army in general
are more judiciously clothed, than any other
I have seen.</p>

<p>Instead of coats with long skirts, their
uniform is a short jacket of white cloth,
with waistcoat and breeches of the same,
and each soldier has a surtout of coarse
gray cloth, which he wears in cold or
rainy weather. This he rolls up in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
small bulk when the weather is good, and
it is little or no incumbrance on a march.
They have short boots for shoes; and, in
place of hats, they wear caps of very stout
leather, with a brass front, which usually
stands up, but which may be let down
upon occasion, to prevent their eyes from
being incommoded by the sun.</p>

<p>Except a very few Hungarians who do
duty within the palace, there are no
troops in the Austrian service with increased
pay, and exclusive privileges, under
the denomination of body-guards; the
marching regiments on the ordinary establishment,
form the garrison of Vienna,
and perform the duty of guards by rotation.</p>

<p>The insolence of the Prætorian bands
at Rome, so often terrible to their masters;
the frequent insurrections of the Janissaries
at Constantinople, and the revolutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
effected by the Russian guards, at
Petersburgh, sufficiently point out the danger
of such an institution. These examples
may have influenced the Austrian
government to renounce a system which
seems to render certain regiments less useful,
and more dangerous, than the rest of
the army.</p>

<p>The Austrian army is calculated at considerably
above two hundred thousand;
and, it is imagined, that there never was
a greater number of excellent officers in
the service than at present; so that in case of
a war with Prussia, the two powers will be
more equally matched than ever. It would
be unfortunate for this Court if it should
break out at present, for there are some
commotions among the peasants in Bohemia,
which occasion a general disquiet,
and by which some individuals have sustained
great losses. One nobleman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the first rank has had his house, and all
the furniture, burnt to the ground, together
with some large out-houses near
his castle.</p>

<p>These excesses, according to some, proceed
from mere wantonness, and love
of mischief, in the people. Others assert,
that they are excited by the tyranny of
the lords, which has driven those poor
men to despair. Whichsoever of these
accounts is true, it seems evident to me,
that it would be much better for the lords,
as well as the peasants, that the latter,
instead of being bond-men, were in a state
of freedom. At present, they pay their
rent by working a certain number of days
in the week for their masters, and maintain
themselves and families by labouring
the other days on their own account.
You will readily believe, that more real
business will be done in one day when
they work for themselves, than in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
days labour for their lords. This occasions
ill-humour and blows on the part of the
master, and hatred and revolt on that of
the peasants.</p>

<p>If the estates in Bohemia were let to
free-men at a reasonable rent, freedom
and property would excite a spirit of industry
among these indolent people. They
would then work every day with cheerfulness
and good-will, and I am convinced
the landlords revenues would increase
daily. In consequence of this, the
peasants would, in all probability, continue
as much attached to the ground
from choice, as they are at present from
necessity.—Do we not see families in
Great Britain remain for many generations
on gentlemen’s estates, though the master
has the privilege of changing his tenant,
and the tenant his master, at the end of
every lease?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>In almost every country in Europe,
except England, the inhabitants are confined
by some barrier or other, to the
situation in which they are born. The
total want of education necessarily obliges
the greater part to gain their livelihood by
bodily labour. National opinions prevent
others from ever rising above the level of
their birth, however sublime their genius,
or however great their acquired knowledge.
But in our island the door of science,
and consequently the road to ambition,
is open to almost every individual. Even
in the most remote villages some degree
of education is bestowed on the poorest
inhabitants.</p>

<p>This may be of little or no importance
to ninety-nine in a hundred; and if the
small number who, by improving this
pittance of knowledge, raise themselves
above the state in which they were born,
very few arrive at any degree of eminence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
the reason of which is, that great genius
is a quality very sparingly dealt out to
mankind. Though it must be allowed,
that much the greater part of the inhabitants
of the same country and climate are
born with nearly the same natural abilities;
and that the degrees of education, and
other opportunities of improvement, gradually
form all the difference which appears
among them in after-life; yet I cannot,
with Helvetius, believe that genius is entirely
the work of education.</p>

<p>I am fully convinced, that Nature is
continually producing some individuals in
every nation of a finer organization, with
an infinitely greater aptitude for science
of every kind, and whose minds are capable
of a more sublime and extensive range of
thought, than is attainable by the common
run of mankind with any possible degree
of culture. This natural superiority
is what I call genius. Wherever a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
share of this is lodged, a little cultivation
will be sufficient, but some is absolutely
requisite to make it appear.</p>

<p>When it does exist in the minds of peasants
in Russia, Poland, and some parts of
Germany, it remains dormant from neglect,
or is smothered by oppression. But in Great
Britain, the degree of education which is
now universal, small as it is, will be sufficient
to rouse, animate, and bring into
action the fire of extraordinary genius, the
seeds of which impartial Nature is as apt to
place in the infant breast of a peasant as of
a prince. The chance of great and distinguished
men springing up in a country, is
therefore not to be calculated by the number
of inhabitants, but by the number whose
minds receive that degree of cultivation necessary
to call forth their latent powers.</p>

<p>On the supposition, that one kingdom
contains eight millions of inhabitants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
another triple the number, many more
men of original genius, and great eminence
in every art and science, may, from the circumstances
above mentioned, be expected
to appear in the first than in the second. In
Great Britain, for example, almost all the
natives may be included in the calculation;
but in the other countries which I have mentioned,
the peasantry, who form the most
numerous class, must be struck out.</p>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>Whether it is owing to the example
of the Empress, or to what
other cause, I shall not take upon me to
decide; but there certainly appears a
warmer and more general attachment to
religion in Vienna, than in any other great
town in Germany: There is also a greater
appearance of satisfaction and happiness
here than in many other cities, where
religious impressions are more feeble and,
less prevalent: It is not improbable, that
the latter may be a consequence of the
former.</p>

<p>Irreligion and scepticism, exclusive of
the bad effects they may have on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
morals or future destiny of men, impair
even their temporal happiness, by obscuring
those hopes, which, in some situations,
are their only consolation. In
whatever superior point of view those men
may consider themselves, who deride the
opinions which their fellow-citizens hold
sacred, this vanity is often overbalanced
by the irksome doubts which obtrude on
their minds. Uncertainty with respect to
the most interesting of all subjects, or a
fixed persuasion of annihilation, are equally
insupportable to the greater part of mankind,
who sooner or later endeavour to put
in a claim for that bright reversion, which
religion has promised to believers. If the
idea of annihilation has been supported
without pain by a few philosophers, it is
the utmost that can be said; such a state
of mind can never be a source of satisfaction
or pleasure. People of great sensibility
seldom endure it long; their fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
desire of immortality overturns every fabric
which scepticism had attempted to
raise in their minds; they cannot abide
by a doctrine which plucks from the
heart a deeply-rooted hope, tears asunder
all those ties of humanity, affection,
friendship, and love, which it has been
the business of their lives to bind, and
which they expect will be eternal. Since
sensibility renders the heart averse to
scepticism, and inclinable to devotion,
we may naturally expect to find women
more devout than men; very few of that
delicate sex have been able to look with
stedfast eyes on a prospect, which terminates
in a dismal blank; and those few,
who have had that degree of philosophical
fortitude, have not been the most
amiable of the sex.</p>

<p>None of my female acquaintance at
Vienna are in this uncomfortable state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
mind, but many of them have embroidered
some fanciful piece of superstition of their
own upon the extensive ground which the
Roman Catholic faith affords. In a lady’s
house a few days ago I happened to take up
a book which lay upon the table,—a small
picture of the Virgin Mary on vellum fell
from between the leaves; under the figure
of the Virgin there was an inscription,
which I translate literally:</p>

<p>“This is presented by —— —— to her
dearest friend —— ——, in token of the
sincerest regard and affection; begging that
as often as she beholds this figure of the
blessed Virgin, she may mix a sentiment of
affection for her absent friend, with the
emotions of gratitude and adoration she
feels for the Mother of Jesus.”</p>

<p>The lady informed me, that it was usual
for intimate friends to send such presents to
each other when they were about to separate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
and when there was a probability of
their being long asunder.</p>

<p>There seems to be something exceedingly
tender and pathetic in blending friendship
with religious sentiments, and thus by a
kind of consecration endeavouring to preserve
the former from the effects of time and
absence.—The perusal of this inscription recalled
to my memory certain connections I
have at home, the impetuosity of which
recollection affected me beyond expression.</p>

<p>I remarked in this lady’s house another
beautiful picture of the Virgin, ornamented
with a rich frame, and a silk curtain to preserve
it from dust; I observed that she never
looked at it but with an air of veneration
and love, nor passed it when uncovered by
the curtain without a gentle bending of the
knee.—She told me, that this picture had
been long in the family, and had been always
held in the highest esteem, for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
both her mother and she owed some of the
most fortunate events of their lives to the
protection of the blessed Virgin, and she
seemed not intirely free from a persuasion
that the attention of the Virgin was in some
degree retained by the good offices of this
identical picture. She declared that the
confidence she had in the Virgin’s goodness
and protection, was one of the greatest comforts
she had in life—that to <i>her</i> she could,
without restraint, open her heart, and pour
out her whole soul under every affliction,
and she never failed to find herself comforted
and relieved by such effusions.</p>

<p>I observed, that devout Protestants found
the same consolation in addressing the Almighty.</p>

<p>She said—She could not comprehend how
that could be—for that God the Father was
so great and awful, that her veneration was
mixed with such a degree of dread as confounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
all her ideas when she attempted
to approach him; but the blessed Mary was
of so mild, so condescending, and compassionate
a character, that she could address
her with more confidence.</p>

<p>She said, she knew it was her duty to
adore the Creator of the universe, and she
fulfilled it to the best of her power, but
she could not divest herself of a certain degree
of restraint in her devotions to him, or
even to her Saviour; but the blessed Mary
being herself a woman, and acquainted with
all the weakness and delicacies of the sex,
she could to <i>her</i> open her heart with a degree
of freedom which it was not possible
for her to use to any of the Persons of the
Holy Trinity.—Regardez sa physionomie,
added she, pointing to the picture,—mon
Dieu, qu’elle est douce, qu’elle est gracieuse!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>These sentiments, however contrary to the
Protestant tenets, and the maxims of philosophy,
are not unnatural to the human
heart.—Voltaire says, that man has always
shewn an inclination to create God after his
own image; this lady formed an idea of
the blessed Virgin from the representation
of the painter, as well as from the account
given of her in the Evangelists; and her religion
allowing the Mother of Christ to be
an object of worship, she naturally turned
the ardor of her devotion to her whose power
she imagined was sufficient to protect her
votaries here, and procure them paradise
hereafter, and whose character she thought
in some particulars sympathised with her
own.</p>

<p>Some zealous Protestants may possibly be
shocked at this lady’s theological notions;
however, as in other respects she is a woman
of an excellent character, and observes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
moral precepts of Christianity with as much
attention as if her creed had been purified
by Luther, and doubly refined by Calvin, it
is hoped they will not think it too great an
extension of charity to suppose that her
speculative errors may be forgiven.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XCV">LETTER XCV.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>The preference which is given by individuals
in Roman Catholic countries
to particular Saints, proceeds sometimes
from a supposed connection between the
characters of the Saints and the votaries;
men expect the greatest favour and indulgence
from those who most resemble themselves,
and naturally admire others for
the qualities which they value most in their
own character.</p>

<p>A French Officer of dragoons, being at
Rome, went to view the famous statue of
Moses by Michael Angelo; the artist has
conveyed into this master-piece, in the opinion
of some, all the dignity which a human
form and human features are capable of receiving;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
he has endeavoured to give this
statue a countenance worthy of the great legislator
of the Jews, the favourite of Heaven,
who had conversed face to face with the
Deity. The officer happened to be acquainted
with the history of Moses, but he
laid no great stress on any of these circumstances—he
admired him much more on account
of one adventure in which he imagined
Moses had acquitted himself like a
man of spirit, and as he himself would have
done—Voilà qui est terrible! voilà qui
est sublime! cried he at sight of the statue—and
after a little pause he added, on voit là
un drôle qui a donné des coups de bâton en
son tems, et qui a tué son homme.</p>

<p>The crucifixes, and statues, and pictures,
of Saints, with which Popish churches are
filled, were no doubt intended to awaken
devotion when it became drowsy, and to
excite in the mind gratitude and veneration
for the holy persons they represent; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
cannot be denied that the gross imaginations
of the generality of mankind are exceedingly
prone to forget the originals, and
transfer their adoration to the senseless figures
which they behold, and before which they
kneel. So that whatever was the original
design, and whatever effects those statues and
pictures have on the minds of calm, sensible
Roman Catholics, it is certain that
they often are the objects of as complete
idolatry as ever was practised in Athens or
Rome, before the statues of Jupiter or
Apollo.</p>

<p>On what other principle do such multitudes
flock from all the Roman Catholic
countries in Europe to the shrine of our
Lady at Loretto? Any statue of the Virgin
would serve as effectually as that to recall
her to the memory, and people may adore
her as devoutly in their own parish churches,
as in the chapel at Loretto.—The pilgrims
therefore must be persuaded that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
some divine influence or intelligence in the
statue which is kept there; that it has a
consciousness of all the trouble they have
taken, and the inconveniencies to which
they have been exposed, by long journies,
for the sole purpose of kneeling before it
in preference to all other images.</p>

<p>It was probably on account of this
tendency of the human mind, that the
Jews were forbid to make unto themselves
any graven image. This indeed seems
to have been the only method of securing
that superstitious people from idolatry;
and notwithstanding the peremptory tenor
of the commandment, neither the zeal
nor remonstrances of their judges and
prophets could always prevent their
making idols, nor hinder their worshipping
them wherever they found them
ready made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>Statues and pictures of Saints which have
been long in particular families, are generally
kept with great care and attention; the proprietors
often have the same kind of attachment
to them that the ancient heathens had
to their Dii Penates.—They are considered
as tutelary and domestic divinities, from
whom the family expect protection. When
a series of unfortunate events happens in a
family, it sometimes creates a suspicion that
the family statues have lost their influence.
This also is a very ancient sentiment; Suetonius
informs us, that the fleet of Augustus
having been dispersed by a storm, and many
of the ships lost, the Emperor gave orders
that the statue of Neptune should not be
carried in procession with those of the other
Gods, from an opinion that the God of the
Sea was unwilling or unable to protect his
navy, and in either case he deemed him not
worthy of any public mark of distinction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>The genuine tenets of the Roman Catholic
church certainly do not authorise
any of the superstitions above mentioned,
which are generally confined to the credulous
and illiterate in the lower ranks of
life.—Yet instances are sometimes to be met
with in a higher sphere: a Frenchman in
a creditable way of life had a small figure
of our Saviour on the Cross, of very curious
workmanship; he offered it for sale
to an English gentleman of my acquaintance;
after expatiating on the excellency
of the workmanship, he told him that he
had long kept this crucifix with the most
pious care, that he had always addressed it
in his private devotion, and that in return
he had expected some degree of protection
and favour; instead of which he had of
late been remarkably unfortunate; that all
the tickets he had in the lottery had proved
blanks; and having had a great share in
the cargo of a ship coming from the West-Indies,
he had recommended it in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
fervent manner in his prayers to the crucifix,
and that he might give no offence, by
any appearance of want of faith, he had
not insured the goods—notwithstanding all
which the vessel had been shipwrecked,
and the cargo totally lost, though the
sailors, in whose preservation he had no
concern, had been all saved—Enfin, Monsieur,
cried he, with an accent of indignation
mingled with regret, and raising his
shoulders above his ears, Enfin, Monsieur,
il m’a manqué, et je vends mon Christ.</p>

<p>Happy for Christians of every denomination,
could they abide by the plain, rational,
benevolent precepts of the Christian religion,
rejecting all the conceits of superstition,
which never fail to deform its original
beauty, and to corrupt its intrinsic purity!</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XCVI">LETTER XCVI.</h2>

<p class="right">Vienna.</p>

<p>Our disputes with the colonies have
been a prevailing topic of conversation
wherever we have been since we left England.
The warmth with which this subject
is handled increases every day.—At present
the inhabitants of the continent seem as impatient
as those of Great Britain, for news
from the other side of the Atlantic, but
with this difference, that here they are all
of one mind:—all praying for success to
the Americans, and rejoicing in every
piece of bad fortune which happens to our
army.</p>

<p>That the French should be pleased with
commotions which must distress and weaken
Great Britain, and may transfer to them an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
equal right to every advantage we gained by
the last war, is not surprising; but why the
inhabitants of every other country should
take part against England, and become
partizans of America, is not so apparent.</p>

<p>I should forgive them, and even join in
sentiment with them, as far as my regard
for the honour and happiness of my country
would permit, if this proceeded from an
attachment to liberty, and a generous partiality
for men who repel oppression, and
struggle for independency.—But this is not
the case.—Those who can reap no possible
advantage from the revolt of America;
those who have not an idea of civil liberty,
and would even be sorry to see it established
in their own country; those who have
no other knowledge of the dispute, than
that it is ruining England; all join as allies
to the Americans, not from love to them,
but evidently from dislike to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>When I first observed this hostile disposition,
I thought it might proceed from their
being offended at that preference which the
English give to their own country and
countrymen, above all others: but this conceit
we have in common with every other
nation on the globe, all of whom cherish
the same favourable opinion of themselves.
It assuredly prevails in France in an eminent
degree.—There is hardly one sceptic or unbeliever
in the whole nation.—It is the
universal creed, that France is the finest
country in the world; the French the most
ingenious and most amiable people, excelling
in all the arts of peace and war;
and that Paris is the capital of politeness,
and the center of learning, genius, and
taste.</p>

<p>This satisfaction at the misfortunes of
Great Britain cannot therefore arise from a
cause which is applicable to every other
country. It may, indeed, in some measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
proceed from envy of the riches, and
jealousy of the power of the English nation;
but, I believe, still more from our taking no
trouble to conciliate the affections of foreigners,
and to diminish that envy and ill-will
which great prosperity often creates.
The French, though perhaps the vainest
people on earth of their own advantages,
have some degree of consideration for the
feelings and self-love of their neighbours. A
Frenchman endeavours to draw from them
an acknowledgment of the superiority of his
country, by making an elogium on whatever
is excellent in theirs. But we are apt to build
our panegyric of Old England, on the ruin
and wretchedness of all other countries.—Italy
is too hot, the inns miserable, and
the whole country swarms with monks and
other vermin.—In France, the people are
slaves and coxcombs, the music execrable;—they
boil their meat to rags, and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
no porter, and very little strong ale, in the
country.—In Germany, some of their Princes
have little more to spend than an English
gentleman:—They use stoves instead of
grates:—They eat sour crout, and speak
High Dutch.—The Danes and Swedes are
reminded, that they are rather at too great
a distance from the equator; and many sly
hints are given concerning the inconveniencies
of a cold climate.—Of all things,
I should think it most prudent to be silent
on this last topic, as so many paltry states
will take precedency of Old England, whenever
it is the established etiquette that rank
shall be determined by climate.</p>

<p>But this consideration has no effect on
my honest friend John Bull. When he is
in a choleric humour, he will not spare his
best friends and nearest neighbours, even
when he has most need of their assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
and when those at a distance seem to have
plotted his ruin.—If his own sister Peg
should show a disposition to forget old
squabbles, to live in friendship with her
brother, and should declare that all who
renounced his friendship were her enemies,
and resolve to conquer by his side, or if that
should fail, to die hard along with him—No!
d—n ye, says John, none of your
coaxing:—You be d—d! you are farther
North than I—Keep your distance.—And
so he falls a pelting Peg with her own
snow-balls; and then turning from her, he
attacks Lewis Baboon, Lord Strut, Lord
Peter, and dashes their soup maigre, olio’s,
and maccaroni, full in their teeth.</p>

<p>But to drop allegory; the universal satisfaction
which appears all over Europe, at
the idea of England’s being stript of her
colonies, certainly does not intirely originate
from political sentiments; but in a
great degree from that reserve which keeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Englishmen from cultivating the friendship
of foreigners; that pride which hinders
them from stooping to humour prejudices;
that indifference which makes them disregard
the approbation of others, and betray
the contempt they are too ready to
entertain for customs or sentiments different
from their own.</p>

<p>These are things not easily forgiven, and
for which no superiority of genius, magnanimity,
or integrity, can compensate. The
same causes which have made foreigners
take part against us in the dispute with
America, induce those of them who are
rich, and can spend their revenues out of
their own country, to prefer France to England
for that purpose. The difference between
London and Paris in point of climate
is very small. The winter amusements of
the former are more magnificent; and perhaps
every conveniency, and most of the
luxuries of life are to be found there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
greater perfection. During the summer
months, by superior skill in agriculture and
a better taste in gardening, England displays
such scenes of cultivation, of verdure and
fertility, as no country on earth can equal.
To these are added the blessings of liberty;
yet few or no foreigners reside in England,
except those she maintains entirely at her
own expence; all the wealthy, after a short
visit to London, returning to spend their
fortunes at Paris.</p>

<p>Exclusive of pecuniary advantages, it
flatters the natural vanity of the French to
find their society preferred to that of all other
people, and particularly to that of their
proud rivals.—Let them enjoy this advantage;
let them draw to their capital the
idle, the dissipated, and the effeminate of
every country in Europe:—but for heaven’s
sake, do you and your friends in parliament
fall on some measure to prevent them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
engaging the affections of our industrious
brethren of America.</p>

<p>Such an event would be attended with
severe consequences to Great Britain, and
probably to America. There are, however,
so many repelling points in the American
and French characters, that I cannot imagine
the adhesion between them could be
of long duration, should it take place.</p>

<p>You may naturally suppose, from some
things in this letter, that the people here are
in a particular manner inveterate against
England, in her dispute with America. But
in reality this is not the case: for although
in general they favour America, I have not
seen so much moderation on that question
any where as at Vienna. The Emperor,
when some person asked which side he
favoured, replied very ingeniously, Je suis
par métier royaliste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish those of our countrymen, who by
your account seem to be carrying their zeal
for America too far, would remember qu’ils
font par naisance Anglois.</p>

<p>Just as I was concluding the above I received
yours, informing me that your young
friend was in a short time to set out on the
usual tour through Europe. I shall take
another opportunity of writing to him on
the subject you desire, at present I must confine
myself to the few following hints.</p>

<p>I hope he will always remember that virtue
and good sense are not confined to any
particular place, and that one end of travelling
is to free the mind from vulgar prejudices—he
ought therefore to form connections,
and live on a social footing with
the inhabitants of the different countries
through which he passes; let him at least
seem pleased while he remains among them;
this is the most effectual method of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
them pleased with him, and of his accomplishing
every object he can have in visiting
their country.</p>

<p>There are instances of Englishmen, who,
while on their travels, shock foreigners
by an ostentatious preference of England to
all the rest of the world, and ridicule the
manners, customs, and opinions of every
other nation, yet on their return to their
own country, immediately assume foreign
manners, and continue during the remainder
of their lives to express the highest contempt
for every thing that is English.—— I
hope he will entirely avoid such perverse
and ridiculous affectation.</p>

<p>The taste for letters which he has acquired
at the university, I dare say will not
be diminished on classic ground, or his
mind be diverted, by a frivolous enthusiasm
for music, or any other passion, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
manly studies and pursuits which become
an English gentleman.</p>

<p>As he regards the confidence of his
friends, the preservation of his character,
and the tranquillity of his mind, let no example,
however high, lead him into the
practice of deep play. By avoiding gaming
he will secure one kind of independence,
and at the same time keep possession of
another, by continuing the habit of study,
till the acquisition of knowledge has become
one of his most pleasing amusements.—Unlike
those wretched mortals, who, to drag
through the dreary hours of life, are continually
obliged to have recourse to the
assistance of others, this fortunate turn of
mind will add to his own happiness, while
it renders him more useful to, and less dependent
on, society.</p>

<p>The preceding sermon, if you think proper,
you may deliver to the young traveller,
with my best wishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>Having delayed our journey several weeks
longer than was intended, merely from a
reluctance of leaving a place which we have
found so very agreeable, we have at length
determined to set out for Italy—and are to
go by the Duchies of Stiria and Carinthia,
which is a shorter route than that by the
Tirol. As the time we are to remain at
Vienna will be entirely employed in the necessary
arrangements for the journey, and
the painful ceremony of taking leave of
friends, you will not hear again from me
till we arrive at Venice.—Mean while, I
am, &amp;c.</p>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
